    "LA Legends #57: Mandarin Noodle House\nEst. 1978 - $$\n\nMandarin Noodle House is one of the oldest restaurants among the wave of Chinese restaurants that now form the essential culinary thread of the San Gabriel Valley. Mandarin Noodle House originated as Mandarin Deli in Chinatown, before cousins of the original owner opened branches around the SGV. The iconic Chinatown original, lauded for its fish dumplings, is long gone, and sometime between its closure and now the other Mandarin Delis changed their name. Despite an apparent shift in focus to noodles, the menu here at this cozy little Monterey Park dining room retains a “Cold Cuts” section from its deli days, with such delicacies as pig ear, beef tripe, and stewed tofu, all beloved and oft-ordered by the Chinese-speaking regulars. \n\nBut they are most well known for the beef noodle soup with handmade noodles. Handmade noodles offer a certain pleasantly firm-chewy texture, and are worth going out of your way for on their own. The beef is a deep mahogany color indicative of long hours spent simmering in that savory, rich brown broth. It’s one of the great noodle dishes of Los Angeles, one I’ve sought out even in the dead of summer. Dai Ho is another great option for this dish, but they’re the new kid on the block compared to Mandarin Noodle House. Which, by the way, is known for more than just the beef noodles, including some excellent pan-fried dumplings, which feature a perfectly crispy skin and juicy pork within. They've also got a stellar onion pancake, so soft and flaky as it pulls apart. It's got a texture almost reminiscent of naan, as opposed to the flimsy, shatter-prone onion pancakes you get at many Chinese restaurants in town. These three items form an essential trifecta here at MNH, but once you've ordered them two or three times, it’s worth venturing into the cold cuts as well.\n\n#montereypark #sgv #chinesefood #dumplings #vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #LAfoodie #LAfoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #californiahistory #americanhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles",
    "101 LA Legends #56: 27th St Bakery\nEst. 1956 - $ \n\nOpen since the 50s, 27th Street Bakery in South LA is the largest manufacturer of sweet potato pies on the West coast. The bakery gets by on the strength of its secret family recipes, handed down over several generations since the 1930s. They’re known to fly sweet potatoes in from Louisiana for their famous pies. They’re just another powerful reminder of the influence of LA (the state) upon LA (the city). Most of their business is wholesale, but the teeny tiny storefront on S. Central & 27th still manages to feel cozy. \n\nAgain, it’s small inside. Maybe it wasn’t always so small before COVID, as they have a sign advertising themselves as an “internet cafe,” presumably from days gone by. As you look inside the glass case, know that sweet potato pie is king, but they also have a variety of southern desserts like pecan pie, named after second generation owner Alberta, and red velvet cake. Not in the mood for a whole pie? They have minis to-go, although they likely won’t be as fresh. \n\nThe first thing you notice biting into the sweet potato pie is the spice - cinnamon of course, but noticeable allspice and nutmeg too, and something I couldn’t quite place. They exercise due restraint with the sugar, not too sweet at all, nice buttery undertones. You can actually see the sweet potato fibers so you know it’s from scratch and not an industrial puree. It’s truly a great pie that’s even better warmed-up. The pecan, on the other hand, is a sugarbomb. You’ll like it if you generally enjoy pecan pie or chess pie, like I do. Otherwise, stick to sweet potato or red velvet cake. \n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #LAfoodie #LAfoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #californiahistory #americanhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #dessert #bakery #sweetpotatopie #southcentral",
    "Diner Theory in Japan \n\nIn the cities of Japan, there exists a kind of establishment that is just oozing with mid-century charm. This is the kissaten (喫茶店), a type of coffee shop associated with the Shōwa era (that is, the reign of the current emperor's grandfather, known in the West as Hirohito). They are very nostalgic places, popular with young and old alike. They are heavily influenced by Western coffee shops from the turn of the last century, but with a strongly Japanese twist. \n\nThe menu at a typical kissaten is a subset of yoshoku, a genre of Japanese food that is heavily influenced by Western cuisine. So you'll find familiar items, like omelets, but altered nearly past the point of recognition to become omurice, a stuffed omelet filled with seasoned rice and topped with ketchup. Kissaten with more limited food menus will just have things like toast or chiffon cake, as well as drinks that have an unexpected popularity in Japan like cream sodas and Vienna coffee (coffee with whipped cream mixed in, which I had never had before going to Japan). \n\nSome kissaten are about the size of a closet, while others feature more elegant dining rooms replete with flower arrangements and walls lined with antique coffee cups. Most all of them feature dark, ancient looking dark wood walls and fixtures. Some of the more relaxed ones even play light jazz music and allow smoking inside. Nearly all of them have either proprietary coffee cups, or antique coffee cups they've collected over the years. Oh, and just to be sure, the coffee at all these places is absolutely excellent - you might expect the quality to take a backseat to the atmosphere, but kissaten take coffee VERY seriously. \n\nI really love the vibe of the kissaten, and found myself looking for one in every neighborhood of every city I visited, and usually found one. They're Western influenced, but we don't really have things like this in the West anymore, at least not in America. The closest thing we have is diners - or Cafe Trieste in San Francisco, but that's about it. Oh how I wish I could just pop into a kissaten any old afternoon, but I guess that just means I'll have to return to Japan someday.\n#Japan #coffee",
    "101 LA Legends #55: Bill's Taco House\nEst. 1949 - $ \n\nThey created a monster in South Central. A twisted beast, a raging chimera displaying the characteristics of both cheeseburger and taco. Yes, Bill’s Taco House on MLK Blvd. is primarily known for the cheeseburger taco, which stands out from other Americanized ground beef tacos in virtue of the fact that the taco is not filled with a picadillo, but with a single hamburger patty, chopped in half and doubled up in the taco shell. \n\nBill’s is both one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in Los Angeles, and also one of the oldest fast food operations in the city as well. So they’re beholden to their own sort of authenticity. This is cultural diffusion at its finest.  \n\n(review continued in comments) \n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #LAfoodie #LAfoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #californiahistory #americanhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #southcentral #tacos #mexicanfood",
    "101 LA Legends #54: Golden Deli\nEst. 1981 - $$ \n\nThe SGV is more known for its variety of regional Chinese restaurants, but there is also a sizeable community of people from Southeast Asia in the area, some of whom started restaurants. Although Golden Deli began life as a Chinese restaurant, catering to the dominant demographic of the region, it struggled to find success until its owners tried a last-ditch effort of featuring their own family recipes on the menu. The Vietnamese fare proved enormously popular, and so Golden Deli grew to become a San Gabriel Valley icon, with lines out the door every day of the week. \n\nTheir menu is extensive, featuring just about every well known Viet dish one could think of, and it’s pretty good. But what makes Golden Deli a truly remarkable place is their cha gio, fried pork egg rolls. I had never had a fried food of any kind so delicious before eating the egg rolls here. I don’t know what secrets they hold here, but they could teach a class in the art of frying based on their incredible egg rolls alone. They just shatter so exquisitely with each bite, and the pork filling is also slightly crispy from the frying process. It’s really just perfect. But the pho is not to be ignored, and if anything it's what GD is most proud of. Slowly simmered for hours in a complex blend of spices and beef brisket, it can compete with the best outside of Orange County or Vietnam itself. They also have a strong roster of other noodle dishes, and a very solid banh mi. But don’t forget an iced coffee, they make it nice and strong here, and they show an even hand when it comes to the condensed milk sweetener.  \n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #LAfoodie #LAfoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #californiahistory #americanhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #Vietnamese #Vietnamesefood #pho #banhmi #eggrolls",

    "101 LA Legends #53: Cupid's Hot Dogs\nEst. 1946 - $ \n\nCupid’s has been serving some of the Valley’s finest chili dogs since the 1940s, first in Van Nuys, then at various locations. These days the flagship stand seems to be in Winnetka, but all their locations feature the iconic heart-shaped sign and their signature chili, based on a family recipe as all decent chili is. I like Cupid’s because it’s a medium-grain chili they’ve got, beanless of course, and not so beefy that you wonder why you’re using meat as a condiment, but not entirely liquified either. As a chili that was developed by an Irish family, it isn't the spiciest specimen in the city, but with mustard and onions it's a good compliment to a hot dog. Those wieners also have a powerful snap, for those who look for that sort of thing. Cupid’s is nothing fancy, but in a city with stiff competition in the chili dog department, it ranks among the best, and for Valley residents, the most nostalgic. They don't have fries at Cupid's, but luckily the Winnetka location is right next door to Daglas Drive-In, who are famous for their beautifully seasoned fries that always come out fresh and hot. Throw a little Cupid's chili on top, plus some Orange Bang to wash it all down, for a match made in heaven. \n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #LAfoodie #LAfoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #californiahistory #americanhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #thevalley #chilidog #hotdogs",
    "The Chiliburger Chronicles \n\nTommy's is an LA institution, and if they're known for one thing, it's their chili burger. A cousin of Greek-inspired Cincinnati chili, Tommy's chili stands apart due to its inclusion of tamale masa as a thickener, which is common in the chili parlors of founder Tommy Koulax's birthplace, Oklahoma. Over the years Tommy's chili burger has been widely imitated, to the point that, as of an LA Times story from 2019, there were over 60 so-called knockoff or bootleg Tommy's restaurants. It's like the Ray's Pizza of LA, only more real because most of the Ray's Pizzas in New York have closed down (there used to be something like 70, now it's down to less than 10). \n\nI'm fascinated by the bootleg Tommy's phenomenon. I think it speaks to the creativity and drive of LA's inhabitants, and displays something of a collective personality. But are the knockoffs any good? I set out to compare some of the best rated knockoffs to the real thing. Granted that most if not all of them start with a base of RC Provisions chili, which can be bought at the grocery store, here are my findings:\n\n(continued in comments) \n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #LAfoodie #LAfoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #californiahistory #americanhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles",
    "101 LA Legends #52: Mini Kabob\nEst. 1989 - $$ \n\nMini Kabob is an Egyptian-Armenian takeout shop run by a former Soviet army cook and his family, and feels like quintessential pre-Caruso Glendale. The “mini” in Mini Kabob refers to a style of making kabob, but the shop itself is also tiny, with only one table available outside on the sidewalk next to an auto shop. There’s a small menu of Middle Eastern favorites here like falafel and eggplant caviar that all feel a little elevated, perhaps because the owner’s son is a culinary school grad and alumnus of several buzzy LA restaurants (he’s also very friendly!). \n\nBut the kabobs are firmly the stars of the menu. The chicken lule is a popular choice, plump and juicy ground chicken with a tasteful pop of sumac. The rice was remarkably good, which is usually hard to say about simple rice, but this is notably buttery and fluffy. It comes with good hummus, not mind-blowing like the kabob but still very good. I never know what to do exactly with the big grilled tomato at kabob places, but the insides of the one they gave me here were melty and gooey from being on the grill, so along with the sumac onions and jalapeno, it was essential. Lavash bread too, chewy and firm but almost flaky as it pulls apart, it’s a bit more versatile I think than pita. \n\nThe falafel are hefty, flavorful but a little bready compared to those at say Falafel Arax. They also have good Caucasian sodas, though sadly not my favorite flavor, Tarragon, but maybe that’s more of a Georgian thing. And don’t forget to order the off-menu fries, which are wavy and shaped like potato chips unlike normal French fries, seasoned with sumac much like everything else. \n\n#Glendale #kabob #armenianfood #vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #LAfoodie #LAfoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #californiahistory #americanhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles",
    "101 LA Legends #51: Phoenix Bakery\nEst. 1938 - $ \n\nLA’s oldest bakery is also the oldest standing food business in Chinatown. Phoenix Bakery provides traditional Chinese treats to the community like almond cookies and seasonal moon cakes, but they became famous citywide for their very unChinese seeming strawberry cakes (actually, fruit-filled sponge cake is very common at bakeries in Hong Kong and Guangdong). Many of the baked goods in-store don’t seem very Chinese in fact. Seems like they’re trying to catch more foot traffic by offering handheld pastries like danishes and croissants. They're ok, nothing special; best focus on the traditional cookies and that fabulous cake. \n\nThankfully though, you don’t need to buy a whole strawberry cake to try it, as they sell it by the slice too. Supposedly it’s based on a family recipe, passed from father to son after a rigorous apprenticeship. The cake is very good, super light and not too sweet. It really lets the fresh strawberries do the talking. The cream and the toasted almonds provide a nice, delicate texture. The cake very much lives up to the hype, and this is now my only destination for future birthday cakes. But the almond cookies, stacked in boxes atop the mochi cooler, are worth your time as well–they are, after all, what made them a household name in Chinatown. See they only started selling the cakes in the 70s, but the cookies had been the star attraction all the way back to 1938. They're crumbly and delicious, not too sweet with just the right amount of nuttiness. This, to my mind, is the ideal almond cookie. And for something light and crispy, those sugar butterflies–basically glazed wontons–are a popular treat.  \n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #LAfoodie #LAfoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #californiahistory #americanhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #Chinatown #bakery #cakes",

    "LA Legends #50: Cole's \nEst. 1908 - $\n\nCole’s has been in the same place, the downtown Pacific Electric Building, since 1908. That makes it the oldest eatery operating in the same location in the whole city. But most people think of it only as “the other French dip place,” the one that isn’t Phillipe’s in other words. But is that entirely fair? \n\nFor one, Phillipe’s is more of a big lunchroom, closer to a cafeteria than a diner, whereas Cole’s is more like a saloon. They also pursue different methods when it comes to the sandwich, but we’ll get to that later. Even if the sandwiches at Cole’s were inferior, which I’m not saying they are, it’s a historical landmark, one of the immovable relics of the Pacific Electric Red Car, LA’s bygone public transit system. Cole’s was directly above the central terminal, and in its heyday, the place mostly served commuters. But PE is long gone, and when the city passed a law finally allowing the construction of skyscrapers in nearby sections of downtown, most of the pedestrian-oriented businesses left the area, leaving Cole’s alone and ominously close to Skid Row. \n\n(Review continued in comments)\n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #LAfoodie #LAfoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #californiahistory #americanhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #dtla #frenchdip #sandwiches",
    "101 LA Legends #49: El Tepeyac\nEst. 1942/1956 - $$\n\nThe most famous Mexican diner in Los Angeles serves burritos the size of your head. Okay, okay, maybe that’s not entirely true. They’re probably bigger than that.  \n\nEl Tepeyac has been in Boyle Heights since 1956, but the founder, Manuel Rojas, had been hard at work in the food business for years before that. Until his death in 2013, he was slinging burritos and other Mexican comfort foods behind that counter almost every day, offering favored patrons shots of tequila even during breakfast hours.  \n\nEl Tepeyac isn’t big on subtlety. The flavors are in no way nuanced, and the ethos here is to overwhelm the customer with generous quantities of food, but by no means does that mean quality is secondary to quantity. The Manuel Special, for example, is a 5 lb. behemoth that serves 2-4 people, though if you eat it alone you get or prize or something. That’s what gets the TV personalities like Man vs. Food out here to Boyle Heights every once in a while.  \n\n(Review continued in comments) \n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #LAfoodie #LAfoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #californiahistory #americanhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #boyleheights #Eastside #Mexican #Mexicanfood #Chicano #burritos #manuelspecial #classicdiner",
    "Dispatch from the Desert II\nA Tale of Two Restaurants \n\nPalm Springs has long been known as a destination for retirees. It is a very old city demographically speaking, and much of its population (at least in PS proper) is as affluent as it is old. There exists a coterie of old standby restaurants that caters to the old folks: Melvyn's, Mr. Lyons, Wally's. There's also an Italian subtype of this genre, including spots like Johnny Costa's, who really tout their perhaps tenuous association with Frank Sinatra, who famously lived here in the desert. There's even a high-end teppanyaki place housed in a replica of a Japanese castle built decades ago. \n\nBut as generations of elderly die off and are replaced by the aged of a new generation, tastes change, and these once-dignified temples to Continental cuisine have to figure out how to appeal to what Boomers like. Most of them don't do so very gracefully. Case in point: Wally's Desert Turtle. Wally's is a spinoff of the Velvet Turtle, a chain of attainable fine dining restaurants that were popular in the LA area in the 70s. Like most of the old stalwarts, they replaced their classic dark wood interiors and red leather booths with bland, lifeless, 2000's-era renovations that, ironically, now look more dated than if they'd just kept things the same. And they've got a menu to match. Gone are the grand Continental entrees prepared \"a l'orange\" or \"almondine.\" Instead we have balsamic reductions, sun dried tomatoes, and random leaves of raddichio thrown about. \n\n(review continued in comments)\n#palmsprings #Desert #vintage #southerncalifornia #finedining #primerib #martini #classicrestaurant #midcentury",
    "LA Legends #48: Sapp Coffee Shop\nEst. Late-1970s/1984 - $ \n\nSapp Coffee Shop does not sell coffee. Or at least, that’s what they’d like you to believe. Sapp began its life as a diner attached to a motel down the street from its current location, serving traditional American breakfast by day and Thai dishes by night. Eventually they moved out of the motel and into a totally nondescript strip mall spot focusing entirely on Thai food. I sometimes wonder what those late night diner days were like, though I can't complain that these days they focus more on authentic Thai dishes than pancakes. But they do in fact sell coffee, of the iced Thai variety that is. \n\nThe decor is real bare bones, just some tables and a few framed photos on the wall. It's a strictly utilitarian space, but that doesn't mean it's not cozy in its way. The owners and staff are very nice and attentive, making sure everyone feel welcome. When I last visited, they were playing strictly inspirational early-00s girl pop - \"One Thousand Miles,\" \"Unwritten,\" \"Everywhere,\"  that kind of stuff.

    "LA Legends #47: The Bigg Chill\nEst. 1986 - $ \n\nLos Angeles has been the epicenter of at least two separate waves of frozen yogurt hysteria. The Bigg Chill has survived both to remain an enduring favorite, and the best fro-yo shop still standing. Of course TCBY set off the nationwide craze in the early 80s, and Pinkberry revived it in the 00s. Both those chains are ghosts of their former selves. But the Bigg Chill, which has never expanded beyond Westwood, is as popular as it was in the Republican administrations of yesteryear - maybe even more so. \n\nPart of its lasting appeal is, perhaps ironically, how unabashedly 80s it looks in here, streaks of neon light dashing around the place. Another part of the appeal is probably the West LA-friendly options of low-calorie, low-fat, dairy-free, and “carbolite” flavors, which are actually pretty good. They’re always rotating out the flavors. If you have no dietary restrictions, just pick a flavor that sounds good, “carbolite” or otherwise. \n\n(review continued in comments) \n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #LAfoodie #LAfoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #californiahistory #americanhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #froyo #frozenyogurt #Westwood #Westside #icecream",
    "10 Diners That Explain America\n#1: DeLuca's Diner \n\nMoving away from California, today I'm bringing you a series that actually moves me closer to California--literally! I went on a road trip last year from New York to LA, taking the Lincoln Highway. I stopped at a different diner in each place, and like to think I learned a lot about America along the way. Today we're starting with DeLuca's in Pittsburgh. \n\nDeLuca's has been located in the Strip District since the 1950s. The Strip is a former industrial/shipping area along the Allegheny River. It was once home to many warehouses and mills, as well as Italian immigrant dockworkers. Both of these influences are prominent at DeLuca's, though these days you'll find more tourists than dockworkers. \n\nDeLuca's is colorful, in more ways than one. Before you even walk in, it's hard to miss their brick red exterior and the giant fiberglass chicken on the roof. On the door hangs a bright yellow sticker inquiring \"jeet yet?\" Hopefully not if you plan to stop in here. Then inside you're met with an array of reds and yellows, turquoise booths and linoleum checkerboard floors. \n\nWeekends are busy, but weekdays at DeLuca's are punctuated by a rotating cast of Pittsburgh characters - over the course of my breakfast, in addition to some elderly regulars, a mailman and later a police officer came in and chatted with the waitress at the counter, and a group of firemen joined the crowd just as I was leaving. The Norman Rockwell vibes are strong here, and DeLuca's retains a very hometown, if not small-town, identity, with ads for local businesses laminated onto the tables. \n\nSpeaking of breakfast, DeLuca's is known for the mixed grill, a hearty platter of just about everything they've got in the kitchen. Peppers, onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, zucchini, potatoes, eggs, and your choice of sausage or ham all piled high, this was clearly a meal designed for an industrial workforce. And it comes with a side of Mancini's toast, which comes from Mancini's Bakery down the street. It's basically just a really good Italian white bread, but if you pick up a loaf from Mancini's, it's twisted like challah.\n\n#Pittsburgh #diner #roadtrip #Americana",
    "LA Legends #46: Eastside Italian Deli\nEst. 1929 - $$\n\nIn LA’s once-thriving Little Italy, Eastside Italian Deli is the last man standing. At one time Eastside was a grocer, kind of like the larger pork stores you’ll find on the East Coast. But by the late 50s, LA Little Italy essentially was no more, prompting the business to shift towards operation as a sandwich deli, which proved popular with the shifting demographics of the surrounding areas. They’re also practically walking distance to Dodger Stadium, so I’m sure that helped keep the business going.\n\nEastside's approach to decor is similar to Pinocchio in Burbank, in that it looks a little like a movie set. It’s unclear to me how functional a deli is in the traditional sense of the term. They have soppressata hanging from the ceiling, but whereas on the East Coast I could ask them to take one down and slice it up for me, here they seem purely decorative. They did have real Italian prosciutto in the deli case though, they import salami and mortadella rather than sourcing it from Boar's Head, and they make their own mozzarella, which are all good signs.  \n\nLA Italian spots, it’s like, they aren’t so serious about adhering strictly to tradition. Places like this, or Pinocchio, or Barone’s, or even Miceli’s, they can deliver the goods when it comes to red sauce, but they’re very casual. They want you to have fun, perhaps because they know their customers aren’t necessarily coming in for a mini-vacation to Italy or get in touch with their Italian roots \n\n(review continued in comments) \n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #LAfoodie #LAfoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #californiahistory #americanhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #Italian #italiandeli #italiansandwich #sandwich #pastrami #redsauce #Eastside",
    "LA Legends #45: Tom Bergin's \nEst. 1936 - $$ \n\nHappy St. Patrick's Day! Need a place to celebrate? \n\nTom Bergin’s has been Los Angeles' premier Irish pub since the Depression. LA has never had a notably large Irish population, so Tom’s has always been kind of an anomaly, though a welcome one it is. They’re known for dark wooden interiors, St. Patrick’s Day parties, a mean Irish coffee, and paper shamrocks hung up everywhere, bearing the names of illustrious customers from over the years. In order to get your own name on a shamrock here, you either have to be a celebrity, or a relatively nice drunk. They advertise \"steaks and chops\" on that old sign, though I saw nothing of the sort coming from the kitchen.\n\nThe Irish coffee was probably invented, or at least popularized, by the Buena Vista Cafe in San Francisco. But I think Tom’s version is better. It’s mixed very well, a perfect proportion of coffee, whisky, and cream. They use a heavy cream that they shake up really fast in a bottle for a frothy texture that, once in the glass, rises up from the bottom and collects in a thin layer at the top, aerating the whole drink. It’s quite nice.  \n\n(review continued in comments) \n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #LAfoodie #LAfoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #californiahistory #americanhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #stpatricksday #stpaddysday #irishpub #Irish #irishcoffee",
    "Nighttime Neon\n\nJoin me for another jaunt through a rainbow-colored midnight to see what we can see. For lack of a more organized religion, I see these big signs as sites of pilgrimage, and myself a humble pilgrim seeking enlightenment. Literally, like they're actual lights. But seriously, there's just something unspeakably magical about driving late at night, smoky music on the stereo, riding wave upon wave of inky darkness in search of a sign, a symbol, some big thing THING to make it all make sense. LA is a city uniquely conducive to this kind of thing, if you're willing to avoid the freeway. It's a tradition shared by many of our city's great insomniacs, one that may not be here forever. I think about the death of the 24-hour diner, about how our city seems to have a cantankerously early bedtime these days. Maybe it's trivial, but I think it's important that late-nite spaces exist, because, well, you're just in a different state of mind when the clock hits 12:01 A.M.

    "101 LA Legends #44 - Chez Jay\nEst. 1959 - $$$ \n\nChez Jay is a dive in the true Guy Fieri sense of the word located just two blocks south of Santa Monica Pier. The neon sign outside lets you know up-front that they do three things: seafood, steak, & cocktails. It’s vaguely nautical in theme, but also hot air balloon-themed because the eponymous Jay liked racing balloons. Supposedly, they have a no photos policy in deference to their historically famous clientele, but it’s more loosely enforced these days because the celebrities mostly hang out at Giorgio Baldi down the street now. Nope, no celebs, just old-timers and lost looking tourists. \n\nThis is the darkest place I’ve eaten at, probably for the same reason as above. Very intimate, with dividers between booths and a couple private rooms. You might not have to compete with movie stars for a seat, but the cantankerous regulars who treat this as their personal clubhouse are another story. If you had a reservation but see some gregarious baby boomer in a Hawaiian shirt walk in ahead of you, prepare to wait. But at the same time, the bar is also quite inviting. With Christmas lights reflecting up at me from my martini, I had to thank the heavens above that a place like this still exists on the Westside.  \n\n(review continued in comments) \n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #LAfoodie #LAfoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #californiahistory #americanhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #divebar #steakhouse #martinis #santamonica #santamonicapier",

    "101 LA Legends #43 - Fugetsu-do\nEst. 1903 - $ \n\nOne of the oldest food establishments in Los Angeles, and one of very few Japanese businesses to survive internment during WWII, Fugetsu-do is known for mochi, manju, and other Japanese confections. They’re particularly popular for Japanese holidays, such as during the New Year festival in Little Tokyo. They make traditional varieties such as strawberry daifuku, but they have more recently branched out to experimental flavors like peanut butter. I’m quite partial to anything with red bean filling, traditional or not. \n\nApparently it takes 10 years to master the art of mochi-making. Thankfully at Fugetsu-do the skill has been passed on from generation to generation of the Kito family for over 100 years. The mochi has a firmly chewy, toothsome texture, almost subtle in its sweetness, which makes it easier to quite suddenly end up eating a lot of them. Also check out the manju (slide 8), which are soft, bready pastries, also typically filled with red bean paste. The shoebox-size storefront is also packed with bags and boxes of various Japanese snacks like corn puffs and Hi-Chew. \n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #LAfoodie #LAfoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #californiahistory #americanhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #japanesefood #mochi #littletokyo #sweets #dessert",
    "Nighttime Neon\n\nThe fantastical neon signage of LA's classic restaurants are a big part of what makes these places so endearing to us. Calling out across a foggy night, they beckon to us with a friendly technicolor grin. I think of classical neon signage as a true art form, one that LA totally mastered in its day. LED fake neon just isn't the same. So last night I took a little cruise, and I documented as many of the best signs as I could. \n\nTruth be told, a lot of LA's old neon signs are out! Places like El Cholo and Bob's Big Boy had them turned off while they were still open, and many others had significant letters burned out. Genghis Cohen just says \"his e,\" and the Blue Room is just \"Room\" for now. I didn't bother trying to capture those, maybe another time when they're fixed. But for now, here's a selection of the several dozen spots I hit. I was out from 6 until 11 doing this! Then I ended the night with some gravy fries from The Hat; somehow they just hit better late at night.\n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #LAfoodie #LAfoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #californiahistory #americanhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles",
    "LA Legends #42 - Donut Man\nEst. 1972 - $ \n\nOn Route 66 in Glendora, Donut Man has been making creative, outsized donuts for over 50 years, first as part of the Foster's Donuts chain until owner Jim Nakano decided to go rogue in the 80s and become the Donut Man himself. They make all the traditional classics of course, including a pretty terrific tiger tail. But the star of the show, and the reason that a donut shop in Glendora ranks alongside the more traditional LA area titans, is their strawberry donut.  \n\nCalling it a donut almost stretches the definition of the word though. Yes there is a donut involved, but it’s so much more, smothered as it is with that delicious strawberry jam. They use fresh strawberries only, which is why these confections are available only during strawberry season in the late spring/early summer. They are however just as proud of the peach donuts, which they insist are just as delicious, available immediately after the disappearance of the strawberry ones. I'm inclined to believe them, since I've only tried the peach.  They have other seasonal flavors as well, ranging from pumpkin to peanut butter, but they’re nowhere near as popular as the strawberry.  \n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #LAfoodie #LAfoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #californiahistory #americanhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #route66 #glendora #sgv #donuts #donutman #strawberrydonut",
    "LA Legends #41: Langer's Deli\nEst. 1947 - $$\n\nLanger’s Deli is an enigma. Supposedly it’s the best Jewish deli in town, but it’s miles away from any contemporary Jewish population centers within Los Angeles. Many Westsiders who swear by Canter’s or Factor’s or Fromin’s have never even heard of Langer’s. Even when Langer’s was founded in 1947, this wasn’t exactly a Jewish neighborhood. But now the vast majority of residents nearby are Central American, making Langer’s feel ever more out of place. The contrast between the prosaic deli on one corner and edgy MacArthur Park across the street is stark. But appearances aside, Langer’s has cemented itself into the very fiber of the city. \n\nLanger’s looks stuck in the 70s, which is probably the last time it was remodeled. For this reason it feels nostalgic, even if this was not the deli your parents took you to as a kid. But warm fuzzies aside, Langer’s makes the best pastrami in LA, and many would argue the best in the whole country. It’s steamed for hours until it’s pull-apart tender, then hand sliced which is rare outside of Katz Deli. Most delis get their pastrami pre-brined and pre-smoked, including Langer’s, but what separates Langer’s from the rest of the pack is how they treat it after it gets to the restaurant. \n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #LAfoodie #LAfoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #californiahistory #americanhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #deli #jewishdeli #pastrami #pastramisandwich",
    "Dispatch from the Desert:\n\nPalm Springs is LA's getaway town, a place to escape the hustle and bustle for the quiet open expanses of the desert. It can be difficult at times, though, to find reliable options to eat. I once thought of the Palm Springs area as utterly devoid of decent eats or any kind of local food culture, but after spending some time there and doing some serious digging, it isn't impossible to find some local treasures.\n\nIf there's one thing that outsiders associate with desert dwellers when it comes to food, it has to be dates. It is their chief economic export, and they're quite proud of it, especially in Indio. That's where you'll find Shields' Date Gardens, who claim to have invented the date shake as we know it. While most tourists just settle for stopping at Lappert's or Hadley's, it is my feeling that Shields towers above them all. Why? Because instead of sticky date chunks that clog up your shake straw, Shields uses patented date crystals for a more smooth, even shake. It also just tastes the most date-y of the shakes I've tried. Plus, you've gotta see \"The Sex Life of the Date,\" a free movie they play in the theater next to their cafe. \n\n(Continued in comments)\n\n#palmsprings #Indio #coachellavalley #palmdesert #desert #desertlife #vintage #retro #food #foodreview #foodblogger",
    "LA Legends #40: Bacon-wrapped street hot dogs\nEst. circa early-1980s - $ \n\nLA has long been home to a vibrant chili dog ecosystem, but somewhere along the line we as a city said \"you know what? I need an even messier hot dog than this.\" And the streets answered the call. Sometimes derisively known as “danger dogs,” you will often find bacon-wrapped hot dogs being sold from small pushcart griddles all around the city. However they can be rather elusive; you cannot seek one out, they have to find you. Typically that means after a concert or major sporting event, or outside your local dive bar after midnight. But if you have a serious craving for one - which only the bravest souls do when sober - they can be found fairly reliably in and around MacArthur Park or the Santa Monica Pier.\n\nThey’re a bastardized descendant of the Sonoran hot dog, adapted to the availability and cost of staple ingredients in LA. Where Sonoran dogs traditionally use bolillos, the LA danger dog uses a regular old hot dog bun, and typically has fewer ingredients, lacking the usual beans and tomatoes of Sonora or Tijuana. If it can’t sit on a hot griddle for some amount of time, it can’t go on a danger dog. Typically the LA version consists of an all-beef dog, wrapped in bacon, then griddled next to a pile of onions and peppers. Sometimes they also offer big sausages instead of franks. You can add jalapeño for extra spice. Usually topped with ketchup, mustard, and mayo for maximal messy splendor. Some view them as unsanitary and thus avoid them (keeping raw bacon in a styrofoam cooler for hours on end may be flirting with disaster, but I haven’t gotten trichinosis yet). But others recognize them for what they are - the greatest drunk food ever devised.\n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #LAfoodie #LAfoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #californiahistory #americanhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #hotdog #dangerdog #streetfood #streetvendor",

There are no beverages here, no raw fish, no wasabi, not even soy sauce. You have to call in the order about 15 minutes before; no ordering at the window, and no substitutions. There’s only six items on the menu (originally just five, but in a concession to changing times they added California rolls in the 80s). Cash only. \n\nThey hand you your order in this very cute branded paper bento box, about the size and weight of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. You can order any number or combination of things from the menu, but it’s best to get the mix box and add a couple of pieces of California roll, since that’s not usually included in the mix. \n\n(Review continued in comments)\n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #LAfoodie #LAfoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #californiahistory #americanhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #Gardena #japanesefood #Japanese #sushi #californiaroll",
    "Defunct LA: The Luau \n\nToday's my birthday, and if I could have one wish to bring back a classic restaurant, I'd pick The Luau in Beverly Hills. It was one of the grandest Polynesian Palaces ever built, suitably extravagant for Rodeo Drive. It had a moat at the entrance and a big lagoon inside that would occasionally get unsanctioned divers who'd had one too many tiki drinks. \n\nIt was owned by Steve Crane, two-time ex-husband of actress Lana Turner. He was a nobody from Indiana with big dreams and lots of charisma. He moved to Hollywood, styled himself as some kind of bigwig cigar trader from back east, and managed to crash enough Hollywood parties to ingratiate himself to the town's elite. While he never made it as an actor, he hit the big time serving them food. \n\nCrane wanted his place to be classy, but also debauched so that his clientele could fulfill their fantasies of \"going native.\" He allegedly hired high-class prostitutes to hang out at the bar and charm the Hollywood honchos. And he made sure his drinks were strong, courtesy of his chief bartender Bob Esmino, one of the original bartenders at Don the Beachcomber. He \"adapted\" many of Donn's recipes and added some flair of his own, including the Luau's signature drink, the Bo-Lo, a powerful rum conconction served in a hollowed-out pineapple. The food was similar to places like Trader Vic's in that they served Cantonese dishes with Polynesian-ish names like \"Tonga-Tabu Pork,\" though the food at The Luau was known to be a touch better.\n\nThough The Luau was his flagship, Crane and Esmino oversaw the opening of the Kon-Tiki chain as well, with outlets in Montreal (slide 8), Portland, Chicago, and Cleveland (slide 9) among others. There was also Kon-Tiki Ports in Boston (last slide) which was less overtly tiki and more nautical. As much as Trader Vic or Don the Beachcomber, Crane helped shape the image of tiki in the American consciousness. Sadly by the 1980s Crane's tiki empire had faded away, aside from a brief Luau revival in the 2000s that no one seemed to like. An oft-forgotten passage in tiki history, but one I'd just die to see for myself.\n\n#vintagelosangeles\n#tiki #Beverlyhills",
    "LA Legends #38: Lucky Boy\nEst. 1960 - $\n\nNew York can keep its overrated bagels and its contrived bacon-egg-and-cheeses. They will never have what we have: phenomenal breakfast burritos. Or good burritos in general. Or a pleasant city to live in. But I digress… \n\nYes, Lucky Boy in Pasadena is famous for their breakfast burritos. Most histories of the breakfast burrito place its origin point in 1970s New Mexico. But if Lucky Boy’s own account is correct, they either invented it here first, or invented it independently at around the same time. And if that’s true, that makes another food invented in Los Angeles, unbeknownst to most of the city, by Greeks.

Many happy memories have been made here by generations of people at its gleaming u-shaped counter beneath tartan wallpaper. But does nostalgia distort our estimation of these burgers? It depends which one you order. Apple Pan has two burgers, distinguished mostly by their signature sauces. \n\nThe Steakburger, the older of the two, is based on a recipe from 1927 and features a sweet red relish. The later-added Hickoryburger has a much more assertive sauce, seemingly comprised of ketchup, BBQ sauce, and Worcestershire, and maybe a little liquid smoke. In fact, I find the hickory sauce overpowers the burger. The Steakburger however is burger paradise. The beef they use is of excellent quality, so the sauce they use makes a difference. You want something subtle that complements the beef, not a sauce so strong that you can barely tell how good the beef is. I like to get my Steakburger without cheese, as when the Steakburger was first devised, the cheeseburger hadn’t yet been invented. My only complaint is they go a little heavy on the chopped lettuce, but that’s a minor quibble. I really like that they griddle the buns for a little extra crunch, regardless. \n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#westwood #westla #burgers#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #lafoodie #lafoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles",

LA loves tiki, and it loves steakhouses (seriously, we’ve got a million of ‘em), so it makes sense that at some point, someone would try and combine the two. The theme is Polynesian, but the food is masculine 1950s stuff like pot roast and pork chops, plus a few signature items like garlic bread and a house salad doused in thousand island. \n\nDamon’s wasn’t always tiki-themed. It opened only a few years after the first tiki bar (Don the Beachcomber’s in Hollywood), and even Don’s was more of a “tropical bar” than a true tiki bar at this stage. But Damon’s had always been known for the real palm tree growing through the middle of the restaurant, to which was added various South Seas ephemera to go with it over the years. Gradually they added more tropical knickknacks until the expansion of the Glendale Galleria forced Damon’s to relocate in 1980, at which point, in a decade when tiki was at its lowest point of pop cultural coolness, Damon’s decided to go all-in on the theme.\n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #lafoodie #lafoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #glendale #tiki #steak #steakhouse",
    "LA Legends #35: The Prince \nEst. 1991 - $$\n\nThe Prince was once known as The Windsor, a British-themed chop house that served chateaubriand and copious slices of roast beef. There actually used to be a dozen or so of this kind of British beef restaurant, but after the COVID-era closure of the Cock n’ Bull in Venice, I think the Tam O’Shanter is just about the only one left. The Windsor became the Prince in 1991, and since then has focused on cocktails and Korean food, though thankfully they left the interior basically untouched. \n\nThe Prince has been and continues to be featured in many movies and TV shows, for the obvious reason that it looks pretty damn cool. The walls, the leather booths, and the carpet are a striking crimson color, matched by dark antique wood fixtures and a u-shaped wooden bar. It’s a very specific slice of 1940s Americana-gone-British. Also, it’s famously haunted. \n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #lafoodie #lafoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #koreatown #koreanfood #friedchicken",
    "LA Legends #34: Mashti Malone’s\nEst. 1980 - $\n\nMashti Malone’s is a Persian ice cream shop in Hollywood. Why “Malone’s” you ask? Are they Irish? As the story goes, the current owner took over the space of an (apparently Irish) ice cream shop, and in order to save on sign money, he just added “Mashti” to the sign and ran with it, giving us one of LA’s most unappreciated roadside artworks. I also appreciate their vaguely anthropomorphic ice cream cone mascot, though both of these signs are unique to the original Hollywood location.\n\nTheir real claim to fame though is their many exotic flavors of ice cream featuring Persian spices. In Iran traditional ice cream is called “bastani sonnati,” and is usually flavored with rosewater and pistachio, but Mashti Malone’s also carries more common flavors like strawberry and chocolate. What makes Mashti Malone’s truly an LA must-visit location though is their faloudeh. Faloudeh is an ancient food - some say it dates to about 400 BC - and is made of frozen syrup thickened with rice noodles. It can be made in different flavors, but the traditional, and the one made at Mashti Malone’s, is rosewater. \n\nI imagine that it’s quite hard to get faloudeh in places where there isn’t a significant Iranian community. And in America outside of LA, that’s slim pickin’s, so I consider us blessed to be home to such a masterful purveyor of the stuff as Mashti’s. For those who didn’t grow up with the taste of rosewater, it can sometimes come off as unpleasantly perfumey. Westerners aren’t used to their food having a fragrance as well as a flavor. If this scares you, the faloudeh at Mashti’s is pretty mild compared to other rosewater desserts I’ve had. Texturally, it’s similar to Italian ice, that is if Italian ice had vermicelli in it. And it’s vegan! It’s good as is, but traditional toppings include fruit syrup, crushed pistachios, and/or mint leaves.\n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #lafoodie #lafoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #iran #persian #persianfood #persianicecream #icecream",
    "San Francisco Legends: Swan Oyster Depot\n\nAlthough I love my home city of Los Angeles, I think of myself as a Californian first, an Angeleno second, and an American third. And I have to admit, there’s just some things San Francisco does better than LA. Like bread. Or burritos. Definitely one of those things has to be seafood. We do ok, but LA never seems to have recovered from the depletion of native abalone, so it’s not exactly a seafood destination (the major exception being immigrant cuisines). Not like SF, where since time immemorial people have travelled from far and wide to eat cioppino and clam chowder from a bread bowl. \n\nSome of the Bay’s most traditional, historic restaurants and eateries are temples devoted to seafood. Sam’s Grill, Sotto Mare, the dearly departed Spenger’s Fresh Fish Grotto over in Berkeley, just to name a few. And of course, the legendary Swan Oyster Depot. Swan is one of the oldest restaurants I’ve ever eaten at. Founded in 1903, they survived the earthquake, as a business if not as a building.

    "LA Legends #33: Al & Bea’s\nEst. 1966 - $\n\nA little ways past Mariachi Plaza, on the other side of the 5 Freeway, stands one of the humbler burrito operations in the area - humble, but certainly no slouch. I would call them a fast food stand, if not for a prominent sign declaring that “WE DO NOT SERVE FAST FOOD. WE SERVE FRESH FOOD AS FAST AS WE CAN.” So let’s just say they’re a roadside stand serving up casual Mexican food as it was in the 1960s. In particular, they’re known for stellar bean & cheese burritos. Admirably simple in a neighborhood sometimes known for burritos as big as your head.\n\nThe bean & cheese comes in two varieties; one with red chile sauce, one with green chile sauce. For some reason the green sauce is more popular. Actually eating this burrito is kind of a race against time. The beans, cheese, and salsa form this kind of unstoppable ooze that erupts out of one side with each bite. You have to keep biting at the overflows to prevent a hot mess from spilling all over your hands. But it’s simply delicious. This is the burrito that all grocery store freezer bean & cheese burritos aspire to imitate. It is the template, and it is very good. They have tacos too, which struck me as Tito’s-esque since they’re hard shell tacos with shredded beef that isn’t exactly machaca. Al & Bea’s is essentially East LA’s answer to the slightly older Tito’s Tacos. \n\nAl & Bea’s has a super casual vibe. The seating area is just the front of someone’s house. Everyone eating here looked like a version of my biker grandpa: tattoos, dark shades, beer bellies and handlebar mustaches. It’s interesting to see a burrito like the ones they sell here. They’re like a 1960s time capsule, resistant to trends towards oversized, overstuffed burritos. Bean & cheese, it’s not rocket science, and yet so few put the care and the craft into them that Al & Bea’s does. \n\n#vintagelosangeles #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #lafoodie #lafoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #boyleheights #eastla #eastside #mexicanfood #burrito",

Kind of like a zebra with its stripes.\n\nUnlike the Hat, the other major player in the LA pastrami game, Johnnie’s is not a fast food window but a small diner with booths and counter stools. They also have outdoor seating that predates COVID by several decades, complete with 1960s fire pits.\n\nInside there’s a big central counter where all the magic happens. The pastrami is boiled in this seasoned broth, in the manner of a French dip. Then the cook dips the bread in the broth, and assembles the sandwich at lightning speed. The sandwiches otherwise come with nothing on them but mustard, flavorful and lubricious enough to need nothing else. \n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#pastrami #diner #classicdiner #culvercity  #vintagelosangeles #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #lafoodie #lafoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles",
    "Defunct LA: Don The Beachcomber\nEst. 1934\n\nThe very first Tiki bar in the whole world started in Hollywood, California. Founded by Ernest Raymond Beaumont Gannt, he would later buy into his own mythology and take the name of his bar/restaurant, Don the Beachcomber, for his own, legally changing his name to Donn Beach. Donn was the kind of larger than life figure that you would expect from a man who would change his name to Beach and start a global phenomenon. Without him, tiki bars would not exist. \n\nGantt (pictured, slide 4) was born in a no-name Texas town near the turn of the 20th century, though he would often claim his birthplace as the more exotic New Orleans. By all accounts he had an unremarkable upbringing, though he would often tell people he spent his youth in Jamaica. Dreams were usually more important than reality for Gantt.

Guelaguetza is 30 years old, but it looks like it could have been opened yesterday. Other than the facade of a previous Korean restaurant that occupied the space, and the mole recipes themselves, nothing about this place feels very classic. Which is fine by me, because the food really delivers. \n\nBy now, most Americans are familiar with mole, which can be found at Mexican restaurants not owned by Oaxacans across both Mexico and the US. But mole is synonymous with Oaxaca and Puebla, the states where it likely originated. And Guelaguetza is synonymous with mole; their website is even ilovemole.com. I have never been here when it wasn’t absolutely packed, with practically everyone ordering some form of mole or a mole-topped dish.

    "LA Legends #30: Attari Sandwich Shop\nEst. 1989 - $$\n\nWhen I was making my list of 101 LA Legends, I had a hard time determining what the most definitive, most iconic Persian restaurant was. Most of the more upscale, sitdown type places are equally as good as one another. There is no one place, in Persian Square or elsewhere, that stands above all the others when it comes to making polo or kabob or bademjan. People are loyal to their place. You might have a fondness for Shamshiri over Darya, or Javan over Taste of Tehran, but they’re all basically solid.\n\nBut Attari is set apart. It’s a casual lunchtime place hidden in a little courtyard just off of Westwood Blvd. You have to be sort of in the know to even know it’s there. Now, what is a Persian sandwich you ask? I’m not entirely sure to be honest, but the sandwiches here are truly the stuff of legend, rivaling any Italian hoagie. Other Persian spots have their followers and their critics, but no one - but no one! - has a bad word to say about Attari’s tongue sandwich.\n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #lafoodie #lafoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #persian #persianfood #persiansquare #sandwiches #deli",
    "Defunct LA: Ptomaine Tommy\n\nThe knockoff restaurant is a fascinating phenomenon. In New York, they have the many different Ray’s Pizza joints, in Chicago there’s numerous fast food shacks calling themselves some variation on Nicky’s or Micky’s, and in San Diego there are so many taco shops with names ending in -berto’s that it’s started spilling over into the rest of Southern California. But in LA we have Tommy’s, and the countless knockoffs thereof that show up as “Tom’s” or “Tam’s,” “Famous Tommy’s” or “Big Tomy’s” (one M). Although many assume that these are knockoffs of the so-called Original Tommy’s, whose original flagship location is on Beverly Blvd in Filipinotown, the truth is that they’re knockoffs of a much older Tommy’s; as it turns out, Original Tommy’s is not so original. \n\nPtomaine Tommy was founded in 1913 in Lincoln Heights by a man named Tommy de Forest and lasted until the late 50s. I’m not sure the origin of the name, but the dictionary definition of “ptomaine” apparently refers to foul-smelling compounds found in decomposing animal and plant matter, often associated with food poisoning. So I guess the name was meant to be self-deprecating in a good natured sort of way. Or maybe the guy just smelled bad. In any case, he specialized in both chili and burgers almost from the start. The fame of his chili in particular attracted the patronage of early Hollywood stars like Mae West.\n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #lafoodie #lafoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #chili #chiliburger #chilisize #fastfood",
    "LA Legends Remembers: The Dragon\nEst. 1980 - $$\n\nI was planning to include The Dragon in my list of 101 LA Legends, which would have shown up much later as #79. However I just recently learned that The Dragon is closing at the end of this month, so let this be both a memorial to the old place, and an advertisement to get down there before its final day. \n\nThe Dragon is a classic example of Korean-Chinese cuisine, and is a venue both popular and refined enough for special occasions, but affordable and cozy enough for a casual dinner with friends. \n\nKorean-Chinese is a hybrid cuisine whose historical roots lie with Chinese people living in Korea. It has its own distinct dishes not exactly found in either Korean or Chinese cooking, most of which are served here at The Dragon. This restaurant is cut from a particular late-70s to late-90s era cloth of banquet room-style Chinese restaurant, one that is relatively healthy in Koreatown and in the SGV. There are other Korean-Chinese restaurants around like Young King, but The Dragon is perhaps the oldest, and the one that’s historically the most respected among the residents of Koreatown. It’s a place for modest celebrations and gatherings, the kind that’s family friendly but also has a full bar.\n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #lafoodie #lafoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #koreanfood #chinesefood #koreatown #jjajangmyeon",
    "LA Legends #29 - El Coyote \nEst. 1931 - $$\n\nEl Coyote is your archetypal combo plate Mexican joint. The waitresses wear peasant dresses all rustic-like, which makes it pretty funny when you catch one texting on her break. It has historically been a favorite of Hollywood types, including, infamously, Sharon Tate. When I was here last, waiting outside for a table, a car drove past, and someone leaned out the passenger window and shouted “THAT’S SHARON TATE’S FAVORITE RESTAURANT!” This is a place people get excited about.\n\nLess than ten years younger than El Cholo, El Coyote is really what spread “Spanish” (i.e. Mexican) food to the rich and famous, and by trickle down, to middle America. El Coyote set the standard for what a Mexican restaurant should look like in the popular imagination for many years, and what the experience should feel like. There seems to be an understanding even that the food is secondary to the overall experience of eating here, and even that the food may be bad. \n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #lafoodie #lafoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #mexicanfood #CalMex #margaritas",
    "Welcome to the first entry in what I hope to be a consistent series: Defunct LA. I want to look back on iconic establishments from LA’s past, which helps us understand where we are today. To start, we’re checking out Hamburger Hamlet. \n\nRemember last week when everyone saw Paul Giamatti and a handful of other stars eating at In-N-Out? That speaks to the iconic status the burger chain has achieved in Los Angeles, but before roughly the mid-90s, there was another casual spot that reigned supreme for celebrities to gather and eat celebratory burgers: Hamburger Hamlet. \n\nI myself never had a chance to eat at Hamburger Hamlet while it was still around, so I find it a little difficult to understand. A burger place that served martinis to Sammy Davis Jr? Huh? As best I can tell, it occupied a place on the spectrum of “gourmet hamburgers” between PJ Clarke’s, a famous steakhouse/tavern in New York known for “the Cadillac of Cheeseburgers” since the 1930s, and Red Robin. \n\n(review continued in comments) \n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #lafoodie #lafoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #burgers #lobsterbisque",

When you walk in the front door, you’ll be confronted with two choices - on your right, you will see a deli counter and numerous shelves filled with Italian wines and import products. On your left, you will see a counter where several sweaty staff are scooping out portions of pasta covered in a bright red sauce to a long line of locals. Both are worth your time, but let’s talk specifically about the restaurant half, henceforth referred to as Pinocchio.\n\nAnd that isn’t just a name, by the way. You will notice a pretty extensive collection of marionettes scattered here and there. They’re not obtrusive, but you may not be able to shake the feeling of being watched. But that’s fine, because everyone’s having a good time here. How could one not at these prices? In the city of Los Angeles, you’d be hard-pressed to find classic Italian-American fare for better quality for your dollar. It may not be as hip as Donna’s or even Jon & Vinny’s, but it tastes as good or better for a fraction of the price. \n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #lafoodie #lafoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #italian #italiandeli #pizza #subsandwiches #redsauce #Burbank",

Though this looks like any other burger stand, this is one of the best places for Yucatecan food in LA. Specifically, people come here for the cochinita pibil, slow roasted pork shoulder seasoned with achiote and bitter oranges. However, about half of people come for equally delicious burgers. Yuca’s took over a spot from a previous Middle Eastern restaurant, and at one time carried on the previous business’ falafel recipe, though they’re no longer quite so eclectic. Still, that burger is pretty good. \n\nThe cochinita pibil is best enjoyed as a burrito, for convenience. It is, to say the least, the juiciest burrito I’ve ever had. It drips a fluid that’s been dyed a neon red color from the achiote, and it will stain your clothes forever if you aren’t careful. But it is delicious, the pork is so incredibly tender, and the flavor is earthy and rich, unlike most any other burrito you will find nearby. The flavor profile of Yucatecan food is like this, complex in a way most Americans aren’t used to, not exactly spicy as in hot, but very spiceful. \n\n(review continued in comments) \n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #lafoodie #lafoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #roadfood #roadsideamerica #losfeliz #yucatecanfood #mexicanfood #burgers #burritos",

Not exactly in conflict with, definitely not the same as the more bohemian and/or bougie dimensions of the city. \n\nRed’s, which sits in the shadow of that OTHER bridge, is one of these kinds of establishments. It’s food for midcentury dockworkers, who could have seen their workplace from the windows. It was founder as Red’s in 1955, but is a revamp of an older restaurant from the 30’s called Franco’s Lunch. Red’s will not accommodate you, you either get it or you don’t. You want vegetables? Walk right out that door, pal. \n\nThe saltiness of the place of course attracts a certain type, such as the late Anthony Bourdain, whose visage hangs the walls. It’s the epitome of the kind of hole in the wall establishments he favored, bold and uncompromising, but taking all comers who can appreciate a diamond in the rough. \n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#vintagesigns #sanfrancisco #sanfran #sanfranciscofood  #sanfranciscorestaurants  #foodreview #foodhistory #sffood #california #history #foodhistory #classicrestaurants #oldsanfrancisco  #vintagesanfrancisco #oldsf #burgers",

It’s the best-preserved, still-operational Googie artifact I’ve ever visited (and I’ve visited quite a few from coast to coast). You sometimes expect old diners to be a little dingy - House of Pies, for example - but Pann’s is basically spotless. The booths look basically new, no cracks or busted seams in sight. Everywhere you look, it’s polished river rock walls or linoleum floors with speckled patterns or formica countertops. It’s what the diner in heaven must look like. \n\nThe menu is little changed from 1958. Pann’s was one of the last diners in town to offer true blue plate specials, as in pre-set meals at discounted prices offered daily, though sadly that was discontinued in the mid-2010s. Otherwise many of the old menu offerings are still there, though sadly again, not at 1958 prices. \n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #lafoodie #lafoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #classicrestaurants #oldlosangeles #vintagelosangeles #classicdiner #googie #googiediner #breakfast #neon #midcentury #inglewood",

And for Bay Cities, that’s the Godmother, somewhat generic both in name and composition, and yet, untouchable in terms of quality.\n\nThe Godmother contains a laundry list of Italian salumi: Genoa salami, mortadella, capicola, ham, prosciutto, and provolone. It also has giardiniera, but a bit unusual for an Italian deli, instead of oil and vinegar they use mustard and mayo. Seems like a California thing. Bay Cities knows their stuff though. Plenty of delis in town just resort to using Boar’s Head meat. And Bay Cities does resort to Boar’s Head when it comes to the non-essentials like ham or turkey.

But, hopefully, here’s a post to warm you up and get you looking forward to baseball season. However it’s also worth mentioning that the Farmer John’s plant, longtime supplier of Dodger Dogs, is about to be demolished, so let’s remember it now. \n\nHorror movie legend and noted gourmand Vincent Price, in his landmark 1965 cookbook A Treasury of Great Recipes, described his journeys around the world to the great restaurants of the day. Le Tour d’Argent in France, the Palace Hotel in Spain, and Tre Scalini in Italy are just some of the legendary eateries featured by Price, all of them considered the best of the best. But despite his worldliness, Price claims in his book that one of his favorite places to eat in the whole world is at Dodger Stadium. \n\nFor over 60 years, the Dodgers and their Dogs have been inseparable. The experience of watching a game there is incomplete without a Dodger Dog. In reality, they taste like middle school cafeteria hot dogs. They’re nothing special in and of themselves, least of all since the Dodgers switched suppliers a few years ago. But there is one thing that makes them special: Dodger Stadium is about the only place in LA where you can get a true, 100% pork wiener. \n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #lafoodie #lafoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #hotdogs #baseball #dodgers #dodgerdogs #ladodgers #wieners #pork",
    "LA Legends Christmas Special: Tam O’Shanter\n\nOf all the old restaurants in LA, there may not be any that take the holidays as seriously as the Tam O’Shanter. Never before had I seen such a quantity of tinsel in one place. Anyone experiencing unhealthy deficits of Christmas cheer should be prescribed one night out at the Tam during December. \n\nBut if you’re looking to get that prescription filled (ok I’ll stop with the medical jokes now) this year, you may be out of luck, since the place is fully booked through the entire month of December, and has been since at least November. One reason for that may just be the popularity of prime rib during Christmastime, but the fact that they hire carolers to perform every night this month-something they also do at sister restaurant Lawry’s-is likely also a draw. However, if you’re really dead set on eating prime rib amongst hanging shillelaghs and mistletoe, it’s first come first serve seating in the pub area, so come early and anticipate stiff competition. \n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #lafoodie #lafoodblogger #california #history #foodhistory #atwatervillage #lawrys #primerib #eggnog #christmas #xmas #scotch #scotland #britishpub",

Here, we happen to have a Japanese diner.\n\nAnd this knick-knack-packed little lunchroom may just be the smallest diner I’ve ever been to. Mind that it’s not one you can linger in, since there’s a 1-hour limit on parking, something all the patrons are painfully aware of. While there were a few mullet-dyed-hair-big-glasses-funny-tshirt types in here, it seems like most of the customers are either neighborhood regulars or Dodger fans.

So here’s the deal: \n\nHarvey’s Broiler was founded in Downey in 1958, featuring state of the art Googie architecture. Its eye catching sign was meant to entice drivers from far down the road. It was quickly a hit among teen car enthusiasts, and it became a cruising destination a la American Graffiti, in no small part due to its expansive parking lot. \n\nIn the 60s it changed its name to Johnie’s Broiler in anticipation of a buyout that never happened from the owner of Johnie’s Coffee Shop on Wilshire, and that’s how most remember it. Like Johnie’s, it’s been in dozens of movies and TV shows, from the X-Files to Mad Men to Earth Girls Are Easy. Its mascot, introduced in 1969 and based on a forgotten 1950s cartoon character, bears a striking resemblance to the Big Boy mascot, which probably made the eventual acquisition seem natural.\n\n(review continued in comments) \n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #lafoodie #lafoodblogger #california #bobsbigboy #bigboy #drivein #carhop #diner #classicdiner #googie #googiediner #downey #carculture #southerncalifornia #1950s",
    "LA Legend #22: Bob’s Big Boy\nEst. 1949 - $$\n\nThe LA area, the birthplace of countless fast food chains, boasts a number of “last surviving locations” of formerly sprawling empires. The Golden Bull, Pioneer Chicken, Steak Corral, and of course the scattered survivors of the Clearman’s brand. Bob’s Big Boy is one of the oldest of this sort. It began essentially as yet another diner in a city bursting with them even then, which gradually gained a reputation both for burgers and for teen car culture. Starting in Glendale in the mid-30s, it expanded across the nation, serving as a transitional, diner-based model of restaurant, between the proto-fast-casual places like Howard Johnson’s and the fast food monstrosities we know today. The Burbank location, a rare diner these days that’s still open 24 hours, also still offers carhop service on weekends, and even has a drive-thru, which is unusual for a diner.\n\nThe flagship location in Burbank is also a kind of transitional example caught between two styles. Built in 1949, it expresses elements of both the earlier 1930s-style Streamline Modern and the later 1950s Googie/Space Age architecture. It is a living fossil of the evolution of a style of art and design unique to Southern California. Incidentally, so is Bob’s Big Boy Broiler in Downey, which used to be called Johnnie’s Broiler before a Big Boy franchisee moved his operations there.\n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#vintagesigns #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #foodreview #foodhistory #lafood #lafoodie #lafoodblogger #california #diner #classicdiner #Burbank #bigboy #bobsbigboy #burgers #carculture #drivein",

Many Angelenos wouldn’t touch this place with a 10-foot pole.\n\nWhen it comes to understanding the popularity of Pink’s, I think it comes down to three things: 1) they have a bunch of “off-menu” specialty items that pique people’s curiosity, many named after celebrities who may or may not have ever eaten their namesake dog; 2) celebrity endorsements; and, to a lesser extent, 3) the chili, based on an old family recipe, which is what got people to eat here before the celebrities started coming ‘round in the late 70s. \n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#losangeles #losangelesrestaurants #losangelesfood #lafood #lafoodie #latenight #fastfood #hotdogs #chili #chilidogs #foodreview #history",

It’s authentically Tito’s.\n\nAll types of people like Tito’s, there’s no one thing that all those standing in line have in common, although a large portion of Tito’s everyday customer base is construction workers, firefighters, and the like.

    "Dinah’s Bonus Post!\n\nIt’s rare that one of the Legends has a second location that’s equally as notable as but totally distinct from the other. But Dinah’s Family Restaurant deserves recognition in its own right, because it’s a beautiful Googie diner relic, and also because it’s got a few things going for it food-wise beyond just the chicken. It’s most popular for breakfast, but it’s open all day. That little round room is where they filmed that scene from The Big Lebowski, by the way - you know, with the toeless girlfriend. \n\nThe most famous item on Dinah’s menu that isn’t fried chicken is the German pancake, which is kind of like if someone said “you know, I love eggs and I love pancakes, what if I combined the two?” It’s similar to a Dutch baby, in the sense that both are a cross between a pancake and a soufflé (although neither are “soufflé pancakes,” which were trendy on TikTok a couple years ago). \n\nIt comes with a bowl of powdered sugar and some lemons and butter. These are the things that elevate the German pancake from ponderously heavy curiosity to something you’ll want to order again. First you apply the butter so it can melt over the hot pancake, then sift some powdered sugar over with your fork. Then you squeeze some lemon juice so that it makes the powdered sugar sort of curl up. When it mixes all together it’s positively divine. \n\n#losangeles #losangelesrestaurants #losangelesfood #lafoodie #lafood #culvercity #diner #googie #classicdiner #americana #breakfast #pancakes #soufflepancake #thebiglebowski",

The chicken is the same at either, but the Glendale location has a menu more focused on chicken, whereas the other one is more of a classic breakfast diner. Dinah’s makes their chicken with a pressure fryer, which they claim makes their chicken uniquely juicy, and they also have a coveted, secret seasoning recipe. They’re also known for their pies, but here’s a little secret: they’re actually from House of Pies in Los Feliz. \n\nDinah’s puts pineapple in a number of beverages and sides here, which feels very mid-century. Their pineapple coleslaw for example is sweet and fluffy, a little like ambrosia but with cabbage. It’s surprisingly tasty. The mac and cheese is melty and tangy, and miraculously not congealed into solid goo even by the time it makes it home. They have biscuits here, but I guess you have to specify because they gave me a roll with my chicken box. And the chicken - so very good. The skin simply could not be crispier, and the meat is incredibly juicy, but barely greasy at all. I wish I could write the words that would allow you to hear what it sounds like to bite into Dinah’s crispy fried chicken, but you’ll just have to hear it for yourself.

    "LA Legend #18 - Tam O’Shanter\nEst. 1922 - $$$\n\nThe Tam O’Shanter is a Scottish pub in Atwater Village, frequented by generations of Disney animators, and if the rumors are true, it served as direct inspiration to Walt Disney for the whimsical design of Disneyland. Not terribly hard to believe just looking around the place; it’s like every inch of the place was meticulously decorated to evoke a cartoon image of Scotland. \n\nPhilosopher Jean Beaudrillard once described Los Angeles as the “hyperreal” city. According to Beaudrillard, Disneyland exists as a place where we acknowledge the purely simulated nature of its reality. We know it’s all pretend, we know that we aren’t taking a picture with the real Snow White. And so this place where we let imagination rule serves as a place where we can safely separate fantasy inside the park from the world outside it, which is supposed to correspond with the real world. But in fact, Los Angeles is just as simulated. These places we take to be landmarks of the city, a lot of them were purpose built to serve as movie sets, to be used again and again. The Bradbury Building, for example, is more than a beautifully designed, historic landmark - it was in Blade Runner, making it more real than real to us when we recognize it. The city of LA is just as much a realm of imagination as Disneyland; a sunny paradise where dreams come true… except for the countless homeless people forced to live on the street, who the rest of us do our best to pretend aren’t there so as not to disrupt our own happy fantasy.\n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #lafood #lafoodie#britishpub #primerib #scotch #atwatervillage #foodreview #foodhistory #disney #baudrillard #simulation #kitsch",
    "LA Legend #17: Falafel Arax\nEst. 1980 - $\n\nLocated at the southern end of Little Armenia for over 40 years, Falafel Arax is among the oldest and best loved of the dozenish mom-and-pop Armenian eateries here, which also includes Sahag’s Basturma and Papillon Bakery as well as the original Zankou Chicken outpost. When you walk in the door, you’ll notice they have both Lebanese and Armenian flags at the counter. Some history: not all of LA’s Armenians came here directly from Armenia.  Diaspora communities formed throughout the Middle East in the immediate aftermath of the Armenian Genocide, and the food that the Armenian cooks of LA make is heavily influenced by the countries their respective families initially settled in. The family that owns Falafel Arax had lived in Lebanon before moving to the US in the 70s, thus their menu has a Lebanese character to it. You may also find Persian-Armenian or Egyptian-Armenian restaurants around the city for the same reasons. \n\nFalafel being in the name, this is the main attraction. But the shawourma on French bread is similarly famed, as is the hummos, kebab and dolma, and several people in line before me ordered the soujuk as well. You seemingly can’t go wrong here, although I eye the ham and cheese with a certain caution. The falafel sandwich comes generously slathered with tahini and topped with a small salad of romaine and tomato. The falafel itself is absolute crispy but not tough, soft but not mushy inside, well-spiced without dominating the other flavors in the sandwich. They did not have hot sauce to-go, and the hot sauce in the restaurant was just off-brand sriracha, but thankfully like any good fast food restaurant in LA they give you pepperoncini, along with some very good pickled turnip spears, shaped like French fries and nearly as addictive. I also tried the hummos, which is rich, creamy, and a little bit spicy. And that beef shawourma on toasted french bread is not to be missed. The moist, tender beef and crunchy bread are perfect counterparts. \n\n#losangelesrestaurants #losangelesfood #losangeles #lafood #lafoodie #falafel #armenian #shawarma #hummus #easthollywood #littlearmemia #cheapeats",
    "LA Legend #16: Original Tommy’s\n\nThere are many Tommy’s locations across Southern California, and even more Tommy’s knockoffs, but the original 1946 walkup location in Filipinotown is the only one that’s open 24-hours. And most people come to Tommy’s for one thing: a dish historically known as the chili-size, but more commonly known today simply as a chili burger.\n\nTommy’s, ironically itself an imitator of old Ptomaine Tommy’s, is to LA what Ray’s Pizza is to New York. There are almost 70 unique knockoffs of Tommy’s burgers, most of them serving chili. Tom’s, Tam’s, Big Tomy’s, Tom’s Family Style, Tom’s Jr, Tomboys… the list goes on. They say imitation is the greatest form of flattery.\n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#fastfood #burgers #chili #tamale #greek #losangeles #lafoodie #lafood #latenight #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants",
    "LA Legend #15: Randy’s Donuts\nEst. 1952 - $\n\nRandy’s needs no introduction, even if you aren’t from LA you’ve seen the big donut from some movie or other. But a question surely remains: just how are the donuts? Are they any good? They’re solidly above average, but nothing extraordinary. My taste in donuts is pretty simple, I’ll usually go with an old-fashioned or a buttermilk donut, unglazed. I find most donuts, especially the glazed or frosted kinds, to be overpoweringly sweet. I like a subtle sweetness in the meat of the donut, so to speak, but nothing more. At Randy’s though, I decided to try the more picturesque yeast-raised, pink frosted donut with sprinkles. This frosting isn’t the most overbearing I’ve had, it’s got a melt-in-your-mouth quality to it that I enjoyed. At the end of the day though, mostly I think a donut is just a donut. They’re all pretty good when they’re hot, and pretty meh when they aren’t. \n\nBut the sign, the history, California car culture, programmatic architecture, that’s what the people of Inglewood and beyond come here for. There are actually about half a dozen giant donuts in the LA area, and at least two giant bagels. Randy’s just happens to be the best-known, and therefore the best-maintained. Some of those other donuts are starting to look a little chocolate-glazed from decades of smog. \n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#losangeles #losangelesrestaurants #losangelesfood #lafood #lafoodie #foodreview #donuts #roadfood #carculture #programmaticarchitecture #fastfood #giantdonut",
    "LA Legend #14: Tiki Ti\nEst. 1961 - $$\n\nTiki Ti is a tiki bar that has been relatively unchanged since it opened in 1961. It’s got an unparalleled neighborhood dive bar vibe, but it’s more than just a local watering hole. Founder Ray Buhen was one of the original bartenders for Don the Beachcomber’s, the world’s first tiki bar, located in Hollywood. His son and grandson still run the place, and they still use the recipes the Buhen family patriarch developed in the early days of the Tiki phenomenon. The drinks are as close to the genuine article as you will find anywhere in America these days. \n\nFor those not familiar with the intricacies of tiki history, it’s not a simple matter of throwing together some rum, some lime, and some sugary syrups. Tiki drinks, as the provenance of near-mythical figures like Donn Beach and Trader Vic, are precious things with complex recipes, some of which can include up to a dozen ingredients in seemingly trivial quantities. People like Trader Vic would come up with recipes, then pre-sort ingredients into bottles with labels that read “#3” or “Gardenia mix” to maintain utmost secrecy and to prevent other bars from poaching his bartenders. But Buhen happened to know most of the classic recipes, and had developed such a reputation among his regulars at Donn’s place that he decided to pack them all up and take them to a new bar he was opening. \n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #losangeles #lafoodie #foodreview #tiki #divebar #maitai",
    "LA Legends #13: El Cholo\nEst. 1923 - $$\n\nStill turning out the hits after all these years. El Cholo recently turned 100, and though they have a handful of locations around Southern California, their flagship location still retains a certain rustic charm. They hail from a time when Mexican restaurant owners had to call their food “Spanish” to get Americans to eat it, and this is reflected in the big neon sign outside that claims it is a “Spanish Cafe.” Although this isn’t what everyone might call “authentic Mexican.” You’ve heard of Tex-Mex? This is Cal-Mex. \n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#losangeles #losangelesrestaurants #losangelesfood #lafoodie #foodreview #koreatown #mexicanfood #CalMex #margaritas",
    "LA Legend #12: International Food Court\nEst. 1987 - $\n\nKoreatown Plaza is a perfectly preserved 1980s mall complete with neon lights, glass bricks, and inexplicable geometric shapes as decoration. It’s also got an incredible food court with an impressive variety of Korean food stalls. Here you can sample the best of casual Korean cuisine at an affordable price, from the usual bulgogi and bibimbap to big plates of soondae (blood sausage). There’s also newer stalls offering Japanese bento boxes and something called “cheesetella,” as well as a Pho 2000 outpost, a local mini-chain with pretty good oxtail pho.\n\nBut a few of the vendors are significantly more popular than the others. PaoJao makes Korean-Chinese dumplings. They’re the size of baseballs and packed with pork and chives, very good. Also popular is Tonkatsu House. Tonkatsu is originally Japanese, but they enjoy it in Korea too, and Tonkatsu House makes it Korean-style, meaning it’s pounded thinner, topped with gravy, and served alongside macaroni salad and a shredded cabbage salad with a heavy mayo dressing. This tonkatsu reminded me strongly of Midwest pork tenderloin I had in Iowa. I guess a good pork tenderloin can transcend cultural boundaries. \n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#lafoodie #losangelesfood #losangeles #losangelesrestaurants #koreatown #koreanfood #foodcourt #80small #neon #mallcore",
    "LA Legend #11- Brent’s Deli\nEst. 1967 - $$\n\nSome delis are known for their pastrami sandwich. Katz’s Deli, the most famous of its kind in New York, is known above all else for its pastrami. It may do other things well enough, but the notoriety of the pastrami is unmatched. Other delis are known more for their welcoming atmosphere. Canter’s, for example, is beloved for its late hours and welcoming disposition, but not necessarily because anything on the menu is the best in the world. But Brent’s Deli is what it is today because it manages to do almost everything well.\n\nAnd that’s because Brent’s insists on quality above all else. They hand slice lox for their bagels, pickle their own gherkins in barrels, bake their own rye bread and desserts like cheesecake, you name it. Not everything can be done in house - few delis actually smoke their own pastrami, for example - but the major things that can be done here, are. At most delis, the salamis hanging above the deli counter are mostly for show, but not at Brent’s. \n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n101LAlegends #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #losangelesfoodbloggers #lafoodie #jewishdeli #pastrami",
    "LA Legend #10: Norm’s\nEst. 1957 - $\n\nNorm’s is a corporate chain, not much different than Denny’s if we’re being honest. But their flagship location on La Cienega is a landmark, and an impeccably maintained example of historic Googie architecture. One benefit of being a corporate chain, I suppose, is that they can afford to keep the place looking respectable, no ripped seats patched with orange duct tape here.\n\nNorm’s is one of the last 24-hour diners left in LA. Once-plentiful, these establishments started their decline with the rise of fast food, but COVID was the final nail in the coffin for many of those that remained in LA. Even those that are still in operation have cut their hours drastically. But Norm’s is still going, all day and all night. It makes me wonder, when all the diners stop serving dinner, what will become of the dishes that are now chiefly associated only with diners? For example, Norm’s has liver & onions, and god forbid Norm’s ever stopped serving dinner, would liver & onions disappear from the collective consciousness forever, consigned to the dustbin of history? \n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#101LAlegends #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #losangelesfoodbloggers #lafoodie #diner #beverlygrove #breakfast #pancakes #latenight #neonsigns",
    "LA Legend #9: Original Farmer’s Market\nEst. 1934 - $\n\nThe Farmer’s Market was founded in the 1930s, but it has roots that reach back even further to when it was a dairy farm, then an oil field in the early 20th century. The Farmer’s Market as it is today started taking shape when farmers from around the LA region started parking here at this central location and selling produce from their trucks. Eventually that evolved into permanent stands, and the rest is history. Unlike LA’s other great public market, downtown’s Grand Central Market, which has more or less completely transitioned into life as a food hall, one can still buy produce and grocery goods at the Farmer’s Market, or get your shoe shined. But the reason most people come here is still to peruse the various food stalls. Many of them are newer, but there are many more legacy vendors still thriving here than at Grand Central. Here are five great ones:\n\n1. Magee’s Kitchen (1934), deli for roast meats like corned beef, on a sandwich or as a plate with sides, more like St. Patrick’s Day corned beef than delicatessen corned beef, pretty good with their trademark hot mustard, good potato salad too\n2. Du-Par’s (1938), classic diner known for great pancakes and pies, they also feature the original patty melt recipe from inventor Tiny Naylor, who founded a namesake restaurant that shared ownership with Du-Pars at one time\n3. Littlejohn’s Toffee (1947), soft and sweet toffee that’s a cut above the rest, with other candy and sweet treats too\n4. Bob’s Coffee & Donuts (1947), no-frills old-fashioned donuts and cheap coffee, the donuts are actually very good\n5. Patsy D’Amore’s Pizza (1949), oldest pizza-by-the-slice in Los Angeles, founded by the famed owner of Patsy’s Pizzeria in NYC\n\n(that last slide is the cover of the Beastie Boys’ album Ill Communication, at a Tiny Naylor’s drive-thru)\n\n#101LAlegends #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #losangelesfoodbloggers #lafoodie #diner #fairfax #donuts #pizza #candy #deli #burger #foodhall #farmersmarket",
    "LA Legend #8: Canter’s\nEst. 1931 - $\n\nCanter’s is LA’s most recognizable Jewish deli. However, I would argue that Canter’s is best enjoyed as a Jewish diner. You don’t come here because they have the best pastrami in the world, or the most paper-thin hand-sliced lox in town, or unforgettable beef salami. You come for the experience, because they’re there for you at any hour day or night, rain or shine, with reliably ok-quality food. Yes they have pastrami and chopped liver and half-sour pickles, but they also have all-day pancakes and ham n’ eggs. And their deli counter, such that it is, is tiny compared to their massive, leather booth-filled dining rooms. LA is full of diners, and Canter’s is a classic Jewish diner. \n\nAs with any of LA’s classic diners, the move at Canter’s is breakfast. And the most classic breakfast at Canter’s is salami and scrambled eggs. Pure old Jewish grandpa soul food, a real test of mettle, delicious with a side of rye toast. Not to say that any of the food is the selling point at Canter’s. It’s the history, the ambience and the comforting familiarity, as with any true diner. Case in point, most tables still have landline phone outlets, from a time when important musician types who ate here would take phone calls at their table. Some things never change. \n\nTheir bakery is about the same as the rest of Canter’s - consistently decent, and decently consistent. It’s where just about every Jewish family around gets treats for Purim and family gatherings, though you might not be impressed if you’re used to New York bakeries/delis. They’ve also got the Kibitz Room, a fun little dive bar off to the side of the second dining room, which sometimes hosts musical entertainment. It’s a hoot and a half, and genuinely one of the better watering holes in this area. And the best part is, you can stumble next door no matter how late and get a big, fat sandwich to soak up the alcohol, because Canter’s is 24 hours. \n\n#101LAlegends #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #losangelesfoodbloggers #lafoodie #diner #fairfax #jewishdeli",
    "LA Legend #7: Pie ‘N Burger\nEst. 1963 - $$\n\nIf you’re in Pasadena, this is one of the top tier LA burgers. I overheard more than one person compare it to In n Out while I was here last. I don’t really get the comparison myself, as I think they’re pretty different aside from the bun, which both places toast lightly before serving. They also use something like thousand island as the burger sauce like In n Out. But the patty is much beefier here, more like a diner burger. \n\nYou know, I can’t recall ever having a toasted bun burger when I lived back east. They seem to like their burger buns soft, like the potato rolls they use for the burgers at Shake Shack. But I can think of at least a dozen West Coast burger shops that toast their buns in a manner similar to In n Out. Gives them a nice crunch and a little bit of caramelized flavor. Maybe that constitutes a regional burger style.\n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#101LAlegends #losangeles #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #losangelesfoodbloggers #lafoodie #pasadena #burgers #pies #diner",
    "LA Legend #6: Musso & Frank Grill\nEst. 1919 - $$$$\n\nWhat can you say about Musso & Frank that hasn’t been said? It hasn’t changed much in the last 100 years, an incredible feat in this economy. There isn’t a single item on the menu today that wasn’t on the menu in 1923, although they’ve also cut quite a few items since then. This is pre-Depression, all-American haute cuisine.\n\nEating at Musso & Frank is a chance to bask in the kind of luxurious dining experience suited to Gilded Age robber-barons, so here more than most places people are willing to actually try dishes that are long out of fashion, like jellied consomme, broiled lamb kidneys, or Welsh rarebit. The food is best described as “Continental,” an old-fashioned set of dishes characterized by the use of thick, reduced sauces and plenty of heavy cream. It went majorly out of fashion in the 70s and 80s, to be replaced by fresh farm-to-table fare and “California cuisine.” But eating at Musso & Frank is a rite of passage for residents of and visitors to Los Angeles alike, and so willingness to try these relics is a demonstration of one’s appreciation for the history of the city.\n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#losangelesrestaurants #losangelesfood #losangeles #lafoodie #lafoodblogger #lafood #hollywood #oldhollywood #vintagefood",
    "LA Legend #5: Grand Central Market\nEst. 1917 - $\n\nLA’s oldest public market, here you will find many independent food vendors with something to make even the pickiest eaters happy, from retro Chinese noodles to trendy breakfast sandwiches to no-frills street tacos and Salvadoran pupusas. When it opened in 1917, it was a true market with produce and dry goods. As downtown declined in the 1960s, many of those vendors left. Through the lean years of the 80s and 90s, a few legacy vendors persevered, catering to downtown workers and commuters who ate there mostly of necessity rather than fancy. \n\nIn the 2000s GCM was revitalized as a modern food hall, now perhaps one of the most successful in the country. There are plenty of hip, newer spots like the once-vaunted Eggslut, but some of the legacy vendors, such as taco spot Roast To Go, have been around since the 50s. Not everyone appreciates the newcomers, and many worry about the future for the few remaining legacy vendors (RIP Chiles Seco). But for now there is stability in the market. \n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#losangeles #lafood #lafoodie #dtla #losangelesrestaurants #lafoodblogger #tacos #pupusas #foodhall #losangelesfood",
    "LA Legend #4: The Formosa has a long and storied history of serving Golden Age Hollywood celebrities in a more casual environment than, say, Musso & Frank. This is where Cary Grant and John Wayne came to unwind, to get a little drunker, a little more care-free than usual. But it was a semi-classy place too, with striking crimson walls and dark, intimate lighting. It’s also built around one of the oldest surviving Pacific Electric Red Cars - if you come here to eat, request a table in the train car. \n\nAs far as I could tell, back in the old days the food was nothing fancy, a notch above diner fare perhaps. I imagine it was a bit like the Frolic Room, but with food. But then the Formosa closed in 2012 after an ill-advised remodel, striking fear and despair into the hearts of the West Hollywood community before being resurrected a few years later by the 1933 Group. They did an excellent job cleaning the place up and restoring its classic interior to its 1940s glory. Though I do wonder, if John Wayne were alive today, would this still be his kind of place? \n\n(review continued in comments) \n\n#losangeles #lafoodie #lafoodbloggers #lafood #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants #westhollywood #formosa #chinesefood #tiki #weho #oldhollywood #foodreview",
    "LA Legend #3: LA’s oldest diner that never closed, until it had to, Original Pantry Cafe is in many ways the quintessential LA legend. It’s a holdover from another era, not always having been surrounded by skyscrapers like it is today. Despite all the changes that have happened around it, nobody really wants it to change, people are happy with their historical anachronism. The food is almost besides the point - they do a few things very well, but for the most part, it is so beloved because it’s a venue for the creation of fond memories, which is why I like these places so much. The last time I was there, a protest made its way down Figueroa, momentarily filling the diner with noise. They were demonstrating about the big current issue, I forget which side they were on. But after a few minutes they were gone, and the Pantry indifferently returned to its perpetual state of relaxed fervor. \n\n(review continued in comments)\n\n#losangeles #lafoodie #lafoodbloggers #foodreview #diner #losangelesfood #losangelesrestaurants",
    "LA Legend #2: In LA, the word pastrami refers to two somewhat related, but altogether different, foods. One refers to the relatively high-quality, meaty hand-sliced cuts of beef most often found at Jewish delicatessens. The other food referred to with this name comes in thinly sliced, chewy ribbons boiled in broth and stuffed into a split French roll, which is often dipped in the seasoned broth. This is not a glamorous food, much humbler in stature than the deli pastrami sandwiches that often go for $20 or more each. \n\nThis latter lunchmeat is what they serve at The Hat, which is I’m sure a familiar name to anyone who grew up in the Inland Empire or the more easterly stretches of the SGV. The original location in Alhambra is a walk-up counter with no seating, but some parking. They claim to have invented the Pastrami Dip sandwich, which is like a French Dip but with pastrami, of course, plus mustard and pickles. It’s a greasy gut bomb, but it has nourished generations of people for whom Route 66 is a local shopping district as much as a national landmark. \n\nBut how does it actually taste? Nothing like Jewish deli pastrami, that’s for sure. The pastrami is very thin, elastic, and juicy, more salty than roast beef but not seasoned quite as intensely as deli pastrami. The bread is nothing special, and the mustard is just French’s. It’s not a sandwich anyone would claim is “the best” at anything, but it’s satisfying, simple, and relatively inexpensive. Their affordability has long been their appeal, filling the bellies of SGV locals for decades at a modest price and without much hassle. \n\n(Review continued in comments)\n#losangeles #lafoodie #foodreview #pastrami #sandwich #history #SGV #sgveats #roadsideamerica #route66",
    "LA Legend #1: Bill’s Burgers - For whatever reason, there’s a certain romance in American culture for the lone, master burger chef. Like a cowboy and his trusty steed stands the fry cook and his/her spatula, at least in the best of cases. Not all beloved burgers are necessarily made by such storied hands. Some, like The Apple Pan, are simply too old for their popularity to come down to one deft set of hands. But in the case of Bill’s Burgers, the legend of the man himself is inseparable from the appeal of the burgers. \n\nStories tell of an ancient, grizzled fellow who has mastered the art of flipping patties. For over 60 years this man has stood solemnly over a griddle that was built shortly after the First World War. That’s part of the secret, of course: the older the griddle, the better seasoned the burger, or so they say. But the other part of the secret is Bill, who is in his 9th decade of life as of this writing. He, his one-time wife Hiroko, and his recently apprenticed nephew are still doing all the work at this tiny roadside shack. Bill is known to be a little eccentric, sometimes snacking on raw beef patties for show, but he’s a basically friendly guy who sometimes chats with those waiting in line. And the burgers are, indeed, quite good. Greasy, but in a satisfying sort of way. (review continued in comments)\n#losangeles #lafoodie #foodreview #burgers #sfv #101LALegends"
