  "This week, we're devoting our entire show to one subject... Eduardo \"Lalo\" García Guzmán @eduardogarciaguzman, the chef of @maximobistrot in Mexico City, one of the top 100 restaurants in the world. At age 10, Lalo's parents brought him and his brother to the US and he began working in the fields, picking crops. He and his family were often sprayed with insecticide. Sometimes, Lalo's parents would put the kids under a blanket to try to protect them.\n\nAt age 14 or 15, he started working in kitchens in Atlanta. He was so fast and so good, he earned the nickname Escoffier Reincarnate. But he also got into trouble. After a liquor store robbery gone wrong, he spent 4 years in jail and was deported. He came back to the US almost immediately because his father was diagnosed with gastrointestinal cancer, which would eventually kill him. In 2007, after rebuilding his life and career, Lalo was deported.\n\nJournalist Laura Tillman @mexicodelicioso chronicles Lalo's story in the book \"The Migrant Chef: The Life and Times of Lalo García\" but ultimately, this is Lalo's journey. It's a singular epic, complete with a cruel twist that reveals so much about the relationship between Mexico and the United States, the two countries that shaped him.\n \n🎧 Tap the link in bio to hear the full story\n\n📸: \nCourtesy of the García family\nAlejandro Yanes\n\n#migrantchef #mexico #mexicocity #mexicanfood #foodstories",

  "Need a hand drafting your weekend dining itinerary?\n\n@elinashatkin has you covered with her roundup of 11 delightful places to eat in Anaheim's Little Arbabia.\n\nSome of them include:\n\n🍽️ @kareemsfalafel \nSince debuting, Kareem's Falafel has earned legions of fans and you'll often encounter a line of hungry customers, waiting for the fantastic falafel. (Pro Tip: order ahead!) We love the classic falafel and the fattoush salad. If you want meat, we recommend the garlic chicken wrap. Kareem's also offers shakshuka, spicy potatoes, kibbeh, shakshuka and baklava.\n\n 🍽️ @alepposkitchen \nStart with an order of muhammara, a smoky dip made with roasted Aleppo peppers and toasted walnuts. The muttabal (eggplant dip) and labne (yogurt dip) are also great. Then, get an order of Mama Suher's yalanji (grape leaves stuffed with rice and spices) and a plate of Aleppo kibbeh, a mix of ground beef, wheat, onions, pine nuts and spices, shaped like a small cigar and deep-fried.\n\n🍽️ @zaitandzaatar \nHere, the goodness starts with the fluffy flatbread, which is baked fresh throughout the day and is perfect dipped into a plate of olive oil and zaatar, the oregano-based spice blend that gives this establishment part of its name. Order the fried cauliflower and a plate of yogurt dip. If you want a small meal, get a wrap. Unlike many such establishments where the shawarma tastes sort of generic, the meat here is soft and well-spiced. For a heartier meal, get a plate, which comes with salad, rice, dips, pickles and sauces.\n\n🔗 Get to the link in bio for more & share your favorite Little Arabia gems ⬇️\n\nStory & images by Elina Shatkin",

The recipe is also in Talati's first cookbook, \"Parsi: From Persia to Bombay: recipes & tales from the ancient culture.\"\n\nThe Parsi people follow the Zoroastrian faith. During the 7th century in the area that is now Iraq, Zoroastrians were forced to convert to Islam or leave the country. Many who left by ship ended up in Gujarat, on India's northwest coast. There, they became known as Parsis aka those who came from Persia.\n\n\"The beauty of Parsi cooking is the fact from our origins, we have all this dried fruit and subtle spicing, saffron, rice, pulaos, and gently stewed meats. And when we arrived in India and hit the shores of Gujarat, that melded in with the fish, coconuts, and the harsher spices and chiles,\" Talati says.\n\nHear @123farokh's full interview with @kcrwevan at the link in bio.\n\n📸Photos by Sam A.

Instead, in Guangzhou, at the only professional vegetarian cooking program in China, she discovered a rich tradition of vegetarian cuisine stretching back more than 2,000 years. \n\nDetermined to make her favorite dishes without meat, @hannah.che started a blog.

  "Until the last few hundred years, almost everybody ate with their hands. The shift to utensils didn't happen until the 1800s.

You might eat with the tips of your fingers. Or clump your fingers together and push forward with your thumb. Or avoid the pinky finger. Or use your whole palm for runny dishes. Those skills vary widely depending on region, household and type of food. \n\nSo why did the West deem the practice \"uncivilized\"?

  "“These big corporate names out here have really desensitized our palate to the tortilla,” says Ricardo Ortega of @kerneloftruthla. When he and his business partner, Ommar Ahmed, launched Kernel of Truth Organics in Boyle Heights, they wanted to produce tortillas the old fashioned way, with only 3 ingredients — corn, cal and water. He jokes that mass manufactured tortillas have more corn on their logos than the actual product.\n\nThese days, Kernel of Truth is one of a handful of Davids fighting the good fight to keep tortillas pure and delicious. It’s not easy being the little guy. Rick describes the early days of the tortilleria, working 20 hour stretches and taking turns sleeping to produce tortillas.\n\nYou’ll find Kernel of Truth’s corn tortillas @sarasmarket, @cookbookmarket, @theecologycenter, @homestate in Hollywood, @altabajamarket, @elmachete1924 and @grassroots68.

  "RIP Barbara Hansen. The longtime Los Angeles-based food writer and journalist leaves behind a legacy of engaging writing, sharing small yet important stories, in-depth reporting and, most of all, countless hours of mentoring and kindness to many who followed in her footsteps. She will be missed, not just by us but by foodies everywhere and by the entire food writing community. We're lucky we had the chance to interview Barbara last year (link in bio).\n\nHer 1971 book, \"California Cooking Style,\" was a primer for exploring the state's diverse cuisine. Although Barbara said she was a disaster in her high school home economics class, she had an inquisitive spirit and an adventurous palette. They inspired her to explore the bounty of Southern California's foods and flavors — Japanese, Korean, South American, Greek, Armenian, Mexican.\n\nBarbara started writing about food and the human connection for the LA Times. The frequent trips she took to Tijuana with her mother and sister inspired her Border Line column, which focused on Mexican cuisine. Barbara was also the inspiration for the younger character in @kimfay's 2022 novel, \"Love & Saffron.\" Set in the 1960s, it traces the story of two women of two different generations, living in different cities, who develop a friendship by sharing recipes and food experiences. Kim also has a lovely tribute to Barbara on her feed.\n\n📸 Photos\n1. This snapshot comes from the dust jacket of \"Mexican Cookery\" by Barbara Hansen (pub. 1989).

  "When Alexis Navarette’s parents came to the United States from El Salvador, they did what so many immigrants all around the world have done to survive: they opened a restaurant. \n\nDecades later, La Flor Blanca Salvadoreña is a South LA institution even as the neighborhood has changed, attracting pupusa lovers across the city to Vermont and Jefferson while staying true to the restaurant’s roots. \n\n“The restaurant, for many people, is a sanctuary for them,” Navarette explains. “It’s something that takes them back, that teleports them to El Salvador. At least it does its best to make them feel at home, make Salvadoran people feel welcome being who they really are.”\n\n“This became a way to connect with the culture as well. I have tried other things besides the restaurant business but something in my head was always calling me back.“\n\n“Something deep inside me said that this is what I have to do. Because even if I get a great salary and level up in a career in tech, these ‘what if’s’ in my head are going to kill me. And I’m going to have that regret on my deathbed.”\n\n“Two, three years ago before I started, [the goal] was to expand, expand, expand.” \n\n“But now that I’m a couple years into this, I feel like the concept now is to make sure that we become that sanctuary for Salvadoran food. Meaning that we keep it as traditional as possible and make sure people feel closer to El Salvador with our ingredients, with our recipes, with our service.”\n\n🎧 More with Alexis on @kcrw or wherever you get podcasts\n📷 Alexis Navarette / @la.flor.blanca",
  "Kimjang is a day-long celebration in Korea where, traditionally, women gather to take the fall harvest of napa cabbage to make kimchi. \n\nEric Kim wrote about the practice of kimjang that allows Koreans around the globe to keep the tradition alive for the @nytimes. \n\n“It's a lot of kimchi that you're making with your community to make it easier to manage,” Kim explains. “Each person has a responsibility. One person is responsible for julienning the daikon. One person is responsible for the sauce—and that person's like a very experienced kimchi maker. So there are different roles depending on your experience level. And it’s just a really good time.”\n\n“I just love that you've taken this cultural thing, which is burying the kimchi in the ground because in the ground, it regulates the temperature in the winter. It keeps it from freezing, and in the summer, it prevents it from being too hot. I just love that there are now [kimchi] fridges—there's technology that replicates this cultural tradition.”\n\n“In fact, UNESCO has coined kimjang as an intangible cultural heritage, which I think is really profound. It means that there's this living knowledge that Korean people possess and kimjang, most importantly, is an effort to pass on that knowledge, because it's sort of like teaching. The best way to learn is by doing.”\n\n“I also think what's really beautiful is the way it's really evolved. With people moving out of Korea into the diaspora, I interviewed a bunch of people from the United States and one kind of common thread was that a lot of us make kimchi alone, or over the phone, or over Zoom. There are modern ways to have a kimjang, and I'm trying to get as many people to make kimchi as possible. I think kimjang kind of explains why you would do it culturally, or emotionally.”\n\n🎧 More with @ericjoonho on @kcrw and get the recipe for napa kimchi in our stories☝️\n📷 Tanveer Badal",
  "For chef Reem Assil, 𝘼𝙧𝙖𝙗𝙞𝙮𝙮𝙖 (which translates to “Arab woman”) is not just the title of her first cookbook, it's a declaration of who she is. Of Syrian and Palestinian descent, she started her journey as an organizer and advocate before finding another community in the world of food.\n\n“It’s funny, people always say I’m the organizer-turned-chef, but in all honesty, the work that I do through food is my medium or tool for building community and organizing,” Assil says. “It took me a long time to figure that out.” \n\n“But in my previous work fighting on the frontlines for workers and residents who are watching their neighborhoods change, fighting against a lot of these regressive policies, I felt like the people that I was organizing [with]—myself included—were losing our voice.” \n\n“And our imagination of what it is that we were fighting for. And I was on the cusp of burnout and food had always been sitting there in the backdrop. Every time I would experience burnout, or some dip in morale, I would go back to food.”\n\n“I went on a trip with my father and went and visited a lot of the food spaces of Syria and Lebanon. And I was just in awe of the role that particularly the bakeries played in the community and just how important and central they were. “\n\n“I always joke that bakeries are where the revolutions are born. It’s where people find life and connection. I really wanted to recreate something like that.” \n\n🎧 More with chef @reem.assil on @kcrw and wherever you get podcasts\n📷 @alannahale",
  "In 2021, Elizabeth Ito’s Peabody Award-winning children’s series, City of Ghosts, followed a team of childhood sleuths across Los Angeles—visiting restaurants like Koreatown mainstay Soot Bull Jeep and Boyle Heights’ historic Otomisan along the way. \n\nHer latest project, MALL STORIES, is a short animated documentary about the people who work at a Mongolian grill restaurant—using their real voices and stories.\n\nIt’s a look at immigrant life and the demands of running a restaurant that goes pretty deep, disguised in the simplicity of its presentation of real people’s struggles. \n\n“To me that’s a really funny juxtaposition,” Ito says. “It’s always funny to combine a cute design with like a real person’s voice for me.”\n\n“Mini is the daughter of the dad who originally bought this restaurant. I think they moved here in the late 90s and then they started the restaurant. I think it wasn’t necessarily like her goal to become the person that runs the restaurant after her dad. I think she had other thoughts.”\n\n“But I think—I mean I guess [for] any family that probably gets into the restaurant business—there’s a point where you sort of have to decide if you’re gonna help your parents so they can retire and you’re gonna take that over. Or does it end there?”\n\n“It was just a really interesting insight into just somebody deciding that they’re gonna go for it.

  "In April 2020, food historian KJ Kearney launched @blackfoodfridays as a way to support Black-owned restaurants and make change while trying to have some fun with it. \n\nNow it’s a @beardfoundation nominated social media initiative for its advocacy in encouraging people to find and support Black-owned food and beverage each and every Friday. His bite-sized clips about Black food culture and history hit at the power of social media advocacy in a tech-driven world. \n\n“You can use food in a political way because food is political,” Kearney says. “But it’s also a way to bring people together.”\n\n“So I hope through my work with Black Food Fridays to radicalize people but in a way that’s fun, in a way that they don’t even realize it’s happening.”\n\n“I’m a product of Charleston County public schools. It was not taught. The Gullah Geechee culture and heritage was not taught. It wasn’t taught from a cultural standpoint, from how special the dialect is, the food, how we influence most of American cuisines. That Black culture as we know it in America started here. None of that stuff was presented. I didn’t know that it was special until I went off to college.”\n\n“My most popular video by far is where I in 60 seconds talk about the connection between Black Americans and cognac. Why is it that Black Americans love Hennessey and other cognac so much? There’s a real story behind that.” \n\n“Black History Month actually started out as Black History Week. And it would take some time for the steam, if you will, to be built up so that legislation could be passed to make it a month-long celebration. Big ideas don’t always start off big. Sometimes they start off really small.”\n\n🎧 More with KJ in our latest episode wherever you get podcasts \n📷 Serena White-Singleton",
  "It’s @kcrwevan’s birthday today! 🥧🎉\n\nTo celebrate LA’s culinary godmother, we turn to the recent @splendidtable episode in which @francis_lam got a whole hour to ask questions from the person who’s usually drawing out stories from everybody else. \n\nBefore she had one of the most influential Italian restaurants in Los Angeles (“a weird little hipster cafe”) and recorded Good Food as a side hustle, Evan studied Italian literature and film at UCLA—and took a trip as a teenager that changed how she thought about food within culture. \n\n“It was 1970,” Kleiman recalls. “I was 17 years old. I graduated really early from high school, and so I took a break. I had been working starting in junior high so I had money saved, and I went to Europe. I had a first-class Eurail pass that my mom gave me as a gift for my trip.” \n\n“I had been a French major in high school. So I went to France, and it pretty much just immediately spit me out. I was a super shy kid traveling. I was by myself. I was walking around as a stranger, as a tourist. They weren't patient with my imperfect French.”\n\n“I came to Italy because I ended up hitchhiking all through Yugoslavia and Greece. I lived in Greece for a while, and then ended up going back to Italy. It was weird, it just felt like a place that I belonged. I don't know how that happens, how your soul feels like it belongs to a place.”\n\n“I was in this train compartment with these men traveling in northern Italy. They were in beautiful suits, with briefcases. And because of my French, I could understand enough of what they were saying to get it. I had never heard grown men talk about what they had eaten and what they were about to eat. I felt that the culture had some place for me.” \n\n“[Food] was kind of my way to understand the world and people—who sometimes made me feel really uncomfortable.” \n\n“And I think what I loved about those years was how I saw that even though the food was incredibly simple, it could be so completely delicious. And that even in a city, everybody seemed to have links to wherever these things were made. Growing up in Los Angeles, you knew about orange groves, but…”\n\n📷 KCRW / Courtesy of Evan Kleiman",
  "Plenty of shows and movies are set in restaurants, but the new series 𝙏𝙝𝙚 𝘽𝙚𝙖𝙧 captures a more nuanced depiction of the intense highs and crushing lows of working in a professional kitchen. \n\nIt focuses on Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto, a young acclaimed chef who made a name for himself in New York’s top tier dining scene who returns home to Chicago to take over his family’s flailing sandwich shop in the wake of his brother’s death. Actor Jeremy Allen White spoke with @kcrwevan about his lead role in the show. \n\n“I gained a lot of respect for cooks and chefs during the process,” White says. “I don't think I quite understood the sacrifice and the commitment that goes into being a chef—the repetition, it's a craft that you have to hone so consistently. At any level, serving food is kind of a performance.” \n\n“The more I spent time in the kitchen, the more I started to draw parallels between putting together a show, or a movie, or a play, and putting together a meal at a restaurant for your guests. There's performance involved in both.”\n\n“Carmy has thrown himself so much into his work. He's not a stranger to burying himself in his work. His identity was so wrapped up in everything he built for himself, and in his identity of being a chef, and being incredibly good at it and successful at it. And his life outside of that seemed pretty empty.”\n\n🎧 More with @jeremyallenwhitefinally on our latest episode on @kcrw \n📷 Courtesy of @fxnetworks",
  "Good Food revisited conversations with newly-minted @beardfoundation Award winners including Alexis Nikole Nelson—aka @blackforager—on how she woke up to tens of thousands of TikTok views following her foraging for wild vegetation and her cultural roots in her neighborhood instead of going to the grocery store. \n\n“My day job is in digital marketing, and focused on social media,” Nelson says. “With Tiktok being the big new thing, my boss wanted me to know how it worked. So around March of 2020, I posted my first video.”\n\n“If we want to go all the way back, my mom is extremely into gardening—that's kind of been her meditative practice. I remember being very little and being outside with my mom, and she pointed out a type of grass that looked a little different than the rest of the grass. And when you broke it, it smelled like onions. She said, ‘This is onion grass. You can eat it if you want to.’”\n\n“This kind of intertwining between nature and the food we eat and how that makes us kind of have a bigger respect. I feel like when you can identify things in nature, you respect it a little bit more than you would otherwise. And now it's just grown into a full-blown obsession.”\n\n“I honestly just believe that there is a degree of reverence for your surroundings that comes from getting to know your surroundings better. So anything that I can do that helps folks feel more connected to their surroundings feels like a win for me.”\n\n“But if someone is seeming particularly persnickety, I also know when to call it, and to just head home. It's a weird time to be a tall, loud, black woman doing an activity that someone can't immediately identify.”\n\n🎧 More with @blackforager in the latest episode\n📷 @racheljoybarehl",
  "Sophie Minchilli was raised in Rome with a view of the Colosseum from her kindergarten classroom and had homemade pasta for hourlong lunches in the everyday simplicity of how she grew up.\n\nShe explains the Italian notion of dolce far niente—the sweetness of doing nothing—as an approach to an easier pace of life.\n\n“Over the years, I came to learn all the things I'd taken for granted as a kid,” Minchilli says. “Just the way I was raised in Italy. All the things I was missing were all the things I grew up with.”\n\n“This sort of Italian lifestyle is the dolce far niente—it's a lifestyle. I think the thing that Italians mastered is not having that sense of guilt when we're apparently doing nothing. But we're actually doing a lot.” \n\n“By sitting and spending two hours in the afternoon playing cards with your friends, you're obviously not doing much, but you're actually socializing, you're keeping your brain going. You're meeting new people, you're having a drink that might lead to dinner.” \n\n“Downtime is necessary to work better. And I think Italians get that perfectly without all of the guilt that I think our society makes us feel nowadays.”\n\n“The easiest way that everyone can do this is by creating your own Italian Sunday tradition. You don't work, so your phone is off. You meet with friends, or family, and you have the longest lunch you can possibly imagine. I think my record was six hours sitting down at the table.”\n\n“You could spend the whole morning cooking with your friends or family. After lunch you’ll have drinks and coffee, then start again with more desserts. It's just endless. It's very slow and long. And then you either nap, or go for a walk, or both. It basically takes up the whole day.”\n\n🎧 Hear more with @sminchilli and her new book on @kcrw\n📷 Sophie Minchilli 1-2 / Elizabeth Minchilli 3 / Courtesy of Thorsons 4",
  "When your grandmother tells you you’re “too much of an a-hole to work for anybody else,” you get it together. Chef Kevin Bludso attributes this kind of straight talk to his success with starting a BBQ joint in his hometown of Compton that led to international recognition. \n\n“Granny’s [Willie Mae Fields] main thing was, ‘Learn you a legal hustle,’” Bludso says. “Learn you something to do just in case something happens. And look at us just coming out of a pandemic. You fall back on what you know how to do.”\n\n“At a time when I lost my job at the Department of Corrections, I fell back on what I knew how to do. I knew how to DJ and I knew how to cater. And all those things that she was teaching me at the time, I didn’t even know I was being taught.”\n\n“I met [business partners] Noah and James and they seemed cool but I still didn’t think they were serious. My granny was having her 90th birthday party and they pushy as hell. I just met them and they asked could they come to my grandmother’s party. What the hell?”\n\n“And they showed up at the party. That just started it all. And I had Noah coming down to Compton at four in the morning to train. And the first couple days he came down I didn’t even tell nobody he was coming down there.

I grew up in the Bronx, NY. It was a melting pot of so many different cuisines—from West African to Caribbean, to even Southern cuisine. There were so many different aspects of what made my American food different. And that's what I wanted to bring to the forefront with this cookbook.”\n\n“Delicious things were coming out of [my mom and grandma’s] kitchen. There was shrimp etouffee, there was gumbo, there was oxtail, curry, goat, Jollof rice, egusi soup—all these different representations of different cultures that make me who I am.”\n\n“It was beautiful to go back [to Victoria Island] as an adult. I was able to travel on the roads that I traveled when I was a kid and really get inspiration. I was cooking a dinner at this restaurant. I wanted to pay homage to my time there as a child and recreate some dishes that I had eaten way back when.”\n\n“They've never seen it done in that way.

  "Jollibee is a chain of restaurants known for its fried chicken that started in Quezon City in the Philippines. In 1978, Tony Tan Caktiong ran a Magnolia ice cream franchise that added savory items to the menu to balance the sweet. The company has opened a new location in downtown Los Angeles with plans to expand globally.\n\nEvan spoke with USC professor @tongsonator—host of our AAPI Women episode last year—about how this Filipino fast food joint went worldwide. \n\n“The [Jolly Spaghetti] is this really interesting combination of a slightly sweet tomato sauce with hot dogs and cheddar cheese,” @kcrwevan says. “What I love about this spaghetti is that it sort of immediately sets out Jollibee as a place for those of Filipino descent, those in the diaspora, to be at home.” \n\n“For anyone who’s expecting some kind of beautiful ragu, this is a very different kind of spaghetti,” Tongson adds. “I see it as existing in the family of things like Boot Knocker soup from South Korea. It’s stuff like hot dogs, processed things that get put into a pasta—whatever was around from the US military for a particular period of time.”\n\n“Because tomatoes aren’t as accessible in the tropics—especially in the Philippines—what you have is often ketchup or these other products to create these pasta sauces. But because it was made with what was available, it isn’t Jollibee’s alone. It’s a kind of spaghetti people have made in the Philippines for a very long time—since WWII.”\n\n“And I do want to say that fried chicken and spaghetti is a common combo. If you’re having a big family party, you’re going to have a big catering tray of spaghetti as well as fried chicken. What Jollibee’s doing is reproducing what it really feels like to go to a Filipino fiesta.”\n\n“There are Filipinos all over the world who were sent out to work all over the place. The Jollibee opening in London was a big deal. People slept in line to be there.” \n\n“It was just a regular fast food joint in the Philippines. Here, it becomes a point of nostalgia—a connection to home. Whereas there, it was a point of connection to here.”\n\n🎧 Hear more of Karen and Evan’s Fiesta Joy in our latest episode \n📷 Laryl Garcia/KCRW",

He was deeply loved by the chef community. \n\nEddie Lin spoke with @kcrwevan to share thoughts about Lupe’s legacy and the impact he had both on his community and on our local food scene. \n\n“He purchased the restaurant back in 1993 and it was a small hole-in-the-wall, eight seats,” Lin explains. “He really just wanted to expand and grow the restaurant and be a part of the community.”\n\n“Prior to that, he was working in the San Gabriel Valley before he got the restaurant, and before he was in the San Gabriel Valley, he actually immigrated from Mexico.”\n\n“In 1978, he moved from Hong Kong which was where he lived at the time to join his brother in Rosarito Beach, Mexico, where his brother had a restaurant.”\n\n“He’s actually pretty famous for his trilingual menu. Chinese, English, and Spanish. This was a very deliberate thing he did because he noticed a lot of his competition in Chinatown, the menus were in Chinese. You were lucky if they were English. So adding Spanish to the menu was a signal that welcomed more of the community.”\n\n“The wonton noodle soup with beef stew and tendon was just this really homey, very simple item that was my kind of connection to my childhood in Chinatown.”\n\n“He definitely represented the more traditional restaurant of Chinatown alongside the newer generation of restaurants that have come in.”\n\n🎧 More on Lupe’s story with @deependdining in our latest episode and you can give to the Liang family’s GoFundMe at the link in our bio\n📷 Courtesy of @hopwoola",

  "The @appletv drama 𝙋𝙖𝙘𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙠𝙤 follows a Korean family across eight decades, starting in rural 1930s Busan and ending in late-1980s Tokyo. In the third episode, an elderly Korean woman living in Japan named Sunja waxes nostalgic about her homeland over a bowl of white rice, a complicated emotion of migration completely lost on her grandson.\n\nProduction Designer Mara Lapere-Schloop and prop master Ellen Freund discuss their intensive work to accurately represent eight decades of food, cookware, and culinary history for the series.\n\n“In each era of the family, food plays a major part,” says Freund. “It speaks to where they are financially, where they're living, what sort of relationships they have, whether they're taking care of others, taking care of themselves, whether it's showing love, or whether it's trying to convince someone of something.”\n\n“The novel is so descriptive in experience and so much about process,” adds Lapere-Schloop. “Food is a huge component of that, and true to any immigrant story or a story of displacement. When you lose all tangible objects, when you're forced to move from place to place or country to country, the only signifiers of your homeland are often language, cultural traditions, and food.”\n\n“And I think that it's a really brilliant device that [showrunner Soo Hugh] employed to conjure back to different time periods, because the way Soo structured the series is that we're jumping through time, and it's not chronological like the novel is. So where food in the novel becomes part of the rigorous detail, in the television series, it becomes our entry into memory.”\n\n🎧 More on Pachinko in our latest episode wherever you get podcasts\n📷 Courtesy of Apple",

  "Canters, Langer’s, and Greenblatt’s have been serving matzo ball soup, mile high sandwiches, and black and white cookies in Los Angeles for decades. Last year, when Greenblatt’s served its last pastrami on rye after 95 years, fear set in that the delicatessen might join the diner in becoming an American dinosaur.\n\nBut a cohort of new delis and bagel shops is thriving right now in Los Angeles. Writer @jeanstrinh tells us how they’re creating community from the inside to preserve traditions and pay homage to the establishments that came before. \n\n“I just imagined that restaurants were secretive about their recipes and vendors and things like that,” says Trinh. “But the more and more people I spoke to who were in this Jewish deli and bagel shop industry, they just kept sharing stories about how they were talking to so-and-so about pastrami or telling someone the best vendor. Or another person about which oven they’re using. And even like, giving each other their business plan.”\n\n“In [David Sax’s] book 𝘚𝘢𝘷𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘋𝘦𝘭𝘪, he was talking about how in other cities, Jewish deli owners did not trust anyone who was from other restaurants. If anybody was linking together, they found it kind of strange. But then in LA, he wrote that it was so different. That everyone wanted to help each other and see each other succeed.”\n\n“I remember Evan Bloom of @wisesons was telling me that Jewish deli food is really special and with a lot of Jewish delis closing like Greenblatt’s, it’s been hard and they want to see these delis stay open. So I think that’s a big part of that.”\n\n“I feel like it is part of just this generation of people who—we’ve gone through the pandemic, I think life has been hard for a lot of people. And people are looking out for one another a lot more.

  "What do we do when faced with a climate crisis that is in lockstep with societies built on colonial power and its methods of economic extraction?\n\nAuthor and agro-ecologist Liz Carlisle has been writing about farming and ecology for years. Her latest book HEALING GROUNDS: CLIMATE, JUSTICE, AND THE DEEP ROOTS OF REGENERATIVE FARMING highlights adaptive traditions from Native American, African American, Mesoamerican and Asian American communities that offer ways forward. \n\n“I have been really interested for over a decade now in talking to farmers who are trying to shift agriculture in the U.S. from being a climate problem to being a climate solution,” Carlisle says.\n\n“Globally, our food and agriculture system is responsible for something like a quarter to a third of greenhouse gas emissions. It's a huge climate problem. But plants are our allies in trying to respond to climate change. Plants can pull carbon and nitrogen out of the atmosphere and work with microbial communities in the soil to draw down some of that carbon and nitrogen to draw down greenhouse gas emissions. There are a lot of farmers talking about this possibility right now.”\n\n“When I started researching this book a few years ago, that was really my question: How much of a climate solution is regenerative agriculture, really?”\n\n“And these are mostly coming from Indigenous communities and communities of color that actually have really, really deep roots [with] philosophies and practices that have been used for hundreds, and in some cases, thousands of years, and are really about shifting from an extractive mode of agriculture to these more reciprocal relationships with land, plants, and animals. And that's where we see the potential to really shift climate change.\n\n“Where does extractive agriculture come from? Why do we have an agriculture that moves all this carbon and nitrogen up into the atmosphere? And it is because it's part of this larger extractive history of colonization on this continent. If we don't face that, and if we don't make people whole, there's no way we're going to make the land whole.\n\n🎧 More on regenerative agriculture wherever you get podcasts\n📷 Courtesy of Neil Thapor",

  "Pysanka—the art of egg decorating—dates back more than 1,000 years. In Ukraine, the tradition is taken to a level of intricacy rooted in the ancient spring ritual of bringing back the sun, calling out the light, and warding away evil dormant in the dark. \n\nNew York artist Sofika Zielyk specializes in the artform, who @kcrwevan first interviewed her in 2007. Because of Ukraine’s current conflict with Russia, we revisit the culture of these eggs.\n\n“In the first few days, when Russia invaded, I, as everybody else, was glued to the TV and constantly emailing my friends and relatives in Ukraine,” Zielyk says. “I couldn't do any work. It was as if I was going through the stages of grief.“\n\n“And I think when I was in the rage phase, I sat down at my work table and I started doing an egg. And that calmed me down. I just went into this meditative state. And it truly helps right now. I feel connected with the people in Ukraine. I don't know how else to explain it.”\n\n“This is an extremely ancient tradition. In pagan times, our ancestors lived with and according to nature. Anything they could not explain, they explained by the power of nature spirits. In the winter time, people thought that the god of the sun was leaving them because the days grew shorter and the nights grew longer. So they had a spring ritual to bring back the sun.” \n\n“They chose an egg as a gift to the sun for a few reasons. Number one, birds fly higher in the air, they're much closer to the sun than people were. So when the people held an egg in their hands, they thought they could harness a little bit of the power of the sun.”\n\n“There's so much symbolism and history. And now these eggs are known as Easter eggs. But in pagan times, it was a spring ritual of rebirth of nature, of getting the sun back.”\n\n“Everybody who comes up to me and says, ‘I’m sorry’ or, ‘I’m hoping this will end soon’—it means so much. Because we are basically powerless here. But I can do my eggs, and I thank everybody for their support.” \n\n🎧 More on pysanka tradition ☀️ in Ukraine in our latest episode on @kcrw \n📷 Courtesy of @sofika_zie",

That idea is sort of colored by the fact that most of us in the West, our experience eating stir-fried food and food cooked in a wok comes from restaurants. But the majority of people cooking with woks around the world are cooking at home.”\n\n“The book is divided up by chapter, and each chapter is a different cooking technique. We cover steaming and simmering. We cover how to cook rice and rice-based dishes, how to cook noodles and noodle-based dishes. There's also pan frying—so things like dumplings and scallion pancakes—as well as deep frying.”\n\n“I use my wok more than any other pan. But I also tend to cook a lot of Asian cuisines—whether it's Chinese, Japanese, or Thai—more than Western cuisines. The main reason I use it most is because there's such a huge diversity and wealth of different cuisines across Asia. Even just across China, there's a huge diversity in the types of dishes and cooking techniques.” \n\n“Every photograph in this book is the same wok that I've had since I was in college.”\n\n“For me, wok hei was always this thing where when I was a kid, my dad would take us around Chinatown looking for beef chow fun. Whenever we went to a place that he really loved, he would always describe it as having that good smoky flavor. And so, to me, that smoky flavor is what wok hei is.”\n\n🎧 More with Kenji and his new cookbook in our latest on @kcrw\n\n📷 \n1 @aubriepick\n2 @kenjilopezalt\n3 @penguinrandomhouse",
  "The culinary influence of the trans-Atlantic slave crossing is seen throughout the American South. In the Costa Chica area in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico, the heritage is equally rich but not often recognized or discussed. \n\nJournalist Bill Esparza reported on Afromexicano cuisine for @eater_la. \n\n“Mexico is a racist country,” Esparza says. “Blacks have been erased in a way that is really even unimaginable here in the United States. They weren’t even part of the Constitution until 2020. They weren’t recognized as a race in Mexico even though there are 2 million Afromexicanos living in Mexico.”\n\n“They’ve gathered in different communities. The biggest is in La Costa Chica, which is between Oaxaca and Guerrero. In those communities, they’re safe. But they don’t have access to education, to healthcare. If they go to Mexico City, someone who’s Black is going to get stopped. And if they say they’re Mexican, they’re going to be asked to sing the National Anthem and they’re going to be threatened with deportation. Deportation to a country they’ve never been to.” \n\n“A lot of people don’t realize that [slavery] was in Mexico as well. It’s more obvious in the Caribbean but Mexico also had slavery. It began to change because many people, especially in Oaxaca, were escaping slavery and running to the coasts. In the Costa Chica region, you have people that are the descendants of the people who had escaped slavery.” \n\n“They do lots of seafood. Tichindas are these mangrove mussels. They’re easy to get there. People just dig for them and they’re really tasty. That’s one of the things they’ll have with mole. They’ll have steamed mussels or fish. Fish head, actually.”\n\n“But as of yet, there are no routes and there is no way to really try this food unless you really go into these communities and do what we did and try to get to know a few locals to take you places.” \n\n🎧 More on Afromexicano cuisine with @streetgourmetla in our latest on @kcrw or wherever you get podcasts\n📷 @_arthur__santos for @eater",
  "Last year, a corner store opened in Koreatown with local ambitions. A series of photos by @hahnbo line the wall at @openmarket.la, each a profile of a legacy Koreatown business. A fourth-generation Hanbok maker, a Korean antique furniture master, a local grocer—every aspect of Open Market from the decor to the food nods to the history and stories of those who came before while finding ways to flip the script. \n\nChefs and co-owners Andrew Marco and Ralph Hsiao were this week’s focus on #GoodFoodInTheWeeds. \n\n“As we were figuring out our next steps after Rice Guys, we were thinking, ‘How can we bring value to a neighborhood other than opening a restaurant?’” says Hsiao. “We were inspired by bodegas in New York where every bodega on the corner block was kind of like the heartbeat.”\n\n“More than the food, we are also very much people-driven individuals,” adds Marco. “And by opening up Open Market, collaborating with both Brian and Yoonna, we were able to finally connect with a neighborhood. We know our regulars by name, we know every single dog’s name, and I think that’s kind of our goal.”\n\n“Growing up as an Asian American son of immigrants, I believe that food is language. The lexicon of what we’re used to and what we’ve grown up with is so natural to us that eating a taco or a pupusa or different Thai dishes like a khao soi or a moo krob—we know these words not because we are from those respective cultures but because we are actually from the culture of Los Angeles.”\n\n“Though we are Filipino-American and Taiwanese-American, that hyphen in between is a line that connects the two. Sometimes as immigrant children, we tend to go, ‘We are not Asian enough or American enough’ when you see it from those individual perspectives. But I tend to see that hyphen as more of a connecting line that we actually are able to bridge that gap, and I think that is super representative in our food.“ \n\n“The space that we’re in in Koreatown, we didn’t want to come in and just pop up,” Hsiao shares. “It was really important for us to also share the history of the neighborhood that we’re in.”\n\n🎧 More in our latest on @kcrw\n\n📷\n1 @hahnbo\n2-6 / 10 @openmarket.la \n7-9 Kenny Ng",
  "In February, the first museum in the U.S. dedicated to Mexican food opened here in downtown Los Angeles. LA Plaza Cocina is an extension of @laplazala with a modern kitchen complete with a large iron comal. \n\nThe musuem plans to be an interactive venue for local chefs to host cooking demos, and where locals can hold events. Their first exhibition co-curated by Maite Gomez-Rejón (@artbites_maite) focuses on Mexico’s rich, indigenous history of corn. \n\n“I co-created [it] with Ximena Martin at LA Plaza,” Gomez-Rejón says. “We thought, for the first exhibit, corn was the natural choice. It’s the life force of the Americas and when we think of ancient myths, the Mayan myths of creation, humans were molded from masa. So it seemed good to start with this sort of life.”\n\n“[For] photographs, we worked with @masienda, and Ximena had this vision that she wanted to have these beautiful, modern photographs. And a lot of them are by @noahforbesphoto. They’re images of farmers in Oaxaca, of women cooking.”\n\n“We really wanted it to not only have the history but really go into the future. And Masienda is a big part of that, working with farmers in Mexico that are bringing back these heirloom varieties of corn. Just to start that conversation of what is happening in Mexico, and it’s a big story—past, present, and future.”\n\n“Mexican food is such an integral part of the cuisine in this country. It’s so a part of American culture. I think it’s interesting just to give this food a context. And to give it the importance that it deserves, the history of the food.”\n\n“And also for Mexicans and Mexican Americans to really feel that pride. Like, ‘These are my people.’ And I think it’s so important because it is one of the most incredible cuisines in the world that has such a rich culture—to give it that life and to give it that story. And to have people learn that story and feel pride in the culture.” \n\n🎧 More in our latest on @kcrw or wherever you get podcasts.

  "In the second season of 𝗕𝗿𝗼𝗸𝗲𝗻 𝗕𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱, @chefroychoi describes the restaurant business as a house of cards—a broken system of exploitation that has been further exposed by the pandemic.\n\nOver its six episodes, Roy cracks open the flaws of the industry, introducing us to people who are looking to flip the script across this city—from Boyle Heights to Leimert Park and Chinatown, where he reflected on the displacement of opening his own restaurant, Chego, a decade ago. \n\n“We always knew we wanted to do an episode on gentrification,” Choi says. “But being the show that we are, we didn't want it to become political or divisive. We want it to become humanizing.”\n\n“The first window in was, can you still be a gentrifier if you're from the neighborhood itself? What if you are the kid of a third generation store or a legacy business? It's your family business that you did homework on when you were a kid. Are you still a gentrifier?” \n\n“And then it led to, the only way to humanize this is maybe I can offer up my own story.”\n\n“By opening Chego, it became this hornet's nest of immediate attention. I don't think that the core of the problem was the small merchants coming in. But what happened was when developers and landlords latch onto it. And then you have these huge condo complexes coming in. What the neighborhood is called changes. And then what happens is, these residents are just forced to leave.” \n\n“I just want to look at it and not paint a picture of complete evil, but look at all sides: legacy businesses, the history in the Museum of Chinatown, the resistance groups, and also the new merchants, and try to stitch together not who's to blame, but what can we do?”\n\n“Whenever you can, it's always important to buy local, and that goes down to toilet paper, to fruit. Support your farmers’ markets, your farmers, your local store, restaurants, juices. Whenever you have a moment, try to be proactive. It's not that hard, and it opens your eyes to your own neighborhood.”\n\n🎧More of this conversation with Roy in our latest on @kcrw or wherever you get podcasts\n\n📷\n1+3 @stephenvanasco \n2 Randall Michaelson\n4 @audrey.e.ma",
  "Chef Alisa Reynolds grew up in Los Angeles in a household that ate dinner together every night. She remembers Fridays when her family would go out to eat meals that first opened her palette to other flavors.\n\n“The first time I had bouillabaisse, it just stuck with me,” Reynolds says. “Like, what is this food? Being Black, we usually had typical American straightforward meals and our Southern cultural food. And from then on, I just remember being a teen, always wanting something different or trying new things.” \n\n“The vibe of @my2centsla is evolved nostalgia. So you feel modern but it makes you remember your past, your grandmother, or your family. I wanted to create a restaurant that felt like a hug. We welcome you when you come in, we thank you when you leave, we dance when it’s your first time. It’s my little piece of heaven in LA.” \n\n“I chose Mid-City in 2013 because I wanted to be in the center of a city that had this great mix and there was a great African American population there. I wanted to keep those bones there. And I wanted all the new people that were going to be planted in the Mid-City area in the next few years to get a vibe of what the neighborhood was and kind of give that cultural experience in the Northern part of LA, outside of South Central.”\n\n“My sister is my right hand. And she actually was my consultant on this menu because usually, she was the cook of the family. And I turned her into a pastry chef, basically. And she actually dived deep into it and she now is amazing and extremely talented. She’s the rock.”\n\n“I wanted to plant myself and do something that I love every single day, and that’s what I do at My 2 Cents. I’m able to give love to my community. And that’s my favorite part of having a restaurant. It’s one of my love languages.”\n\n 🎧 More #GoodFoodInTheWeeds in our latest on @kcrw\n📷 @my2centsla",
  "What does it take for 19 NFL football players to adopt a plant-based diet? Try comparing their bodies to a Lamborghini, and meat to regular gas. That's what chef @charitymorgan did when she started cooking 100% plant-based meals for the Tennessee Titans.\n\nBy turning to the Creole and Puerto Rican spices she grew up with, she was able to find new ways to eat familiar flavors. She shared some plant-based snacks from her new book 𝙐𝙣𝙗𝙚𝙡𝙞𝙚𝙫𝙖𝙗𝙡𝙮 𝙑𝙚𝙜𝙖𝙣 for today or any future Game Days and gatherings. \n\n“In 2015 I tried to go plant-based and I failed miserably,” Morgan explains. “And I found that connection of why I failed. It was all these memories and things that I had as a child that I felt like I was losing out on. All that culture in my Puerto Rican background and my Creole and Cajun roots was just gone and I was like, hold on, that's not life to me.”\n\n“I had to actually identify it to real people, real memories. That's what food does for people, it brings back memory. Think about your grandmother, think about your mother. Those are beautiful memories that I'm not trying to take away from my plate or even someone else’s.”\n\n“When I first went vegan, I got a lot of ‘How can you say you're vegan when you don't do this or that?’ All these parameters and rules just frustrated me. It pissed me off, and I said, ‘That isn't inspiring. That doesn't make me want to be vegan.’ And I didn't want to take it out on the message in the movement.”\n\n“It's using all the possibilities instead of ‘What I can't have.’ When you tap into the world of creativity, you realize that you have hundreds of thousands of different ingredients at your fingertips, opposed to the two to five ingredients that you cannot have.”\n\n🎧 More with Charity in our latest episode on @kcrw \n📷 Courtesy of @clarksonpotter",
  "Street food carts in Los Angeles have been ubiquitous and utilitarian by design. But for Richard Gomez of @revolution_carts, redesigning how food carts looked was about changing lives. \n\n“In 2019, I was invited to join a meeting with the Sidewalk Vending and the LA County Public Health Department to try to come up with a solution to illegal sidewalk vending,” Gomez shares. “That’s how the whole beginning of Revolution Carts began.”\n\n“The people who were sidewalk vending wanted to be able to do things the right way. And they were looking at the Health Department to give them a pathway to be able to legitimize their business. The issue with the Health Department was that the code was written for restaurants and mobile food trucks, and they didn’t really have a guide for how sidewalk vending could be incorporated into our city.”\n\n“One of the complaints I heard [at city council public hearings] against street vending was that sidewalk vending was an eyesore to some people.”\n\n“So I wanted to focus on the aesthetics. I wanted to build something that was eye-catching, that was beautiful. I thought about classical Americana and curvy, pastel colors. Classic cars. Lowriders. Something that Angelenos could really relate to. This way it becomes a part of our whole Angeleno culture.”\n\n“Designing the cart with all these requirements but still being able to keep it very small so that someone could push it on the sidewalk, that it’s not going to be too heavy—there were a lot of parameters that become hurdles.”\n\n“And in April 2021, they finally approved it.” \n\n“Whenever I saw people selling tamales here in Los Angeles, it was a vivid memory of seeing my brother selling [in Jalisco] and remembering how with the money he would make, he would buy us the colorful cereals.”\n\n“To be able to change people’s lives—to be able to see a single mother go be able to make that extra amount of money to feed her kids, to push them through their schooling, and put food on the table—that is really where my greatest satisfaction comes from.”\n\n“This whole trajectory has actually pushed me to become more of an activist.”\n\n🎧 More #GoodFoodInTheWeeds on the latest episode @kcrw\n📷 @revolution_carts",
  "Today is the start of the Lunar New Year, ushering in the #YearOfTheTiger. The holiday is celebrated across many countries in Asia, including China, Vietnam, and Singapore. In the city-state with more than five and a half million people, celebrations vary widely due to the rich diversity of its residents. \n\nAuthor of the cookbook and memoir 𝙂𝙧𝙤𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙐𝙥 𝙞𝙣 𝙖 𝙉𝙤𝙣𝙮𝙖 𝙆𝙞𝙩𝙘𝙝𝙚𝙣, Sharon Wee (@nonya.global) collected her mother’s recipes to share Peranakan family traditions including almond cookies and small dishes on long tables. \n\n“I’m a fifth generation Peranakan on both my father’s and mother’s sides,” Wee shares. “The Peranakans descend from the earliest generation of Chinese immigrants to Singapore [and] Malaysia primarily from as early as the 1500s.” \n\n“What characterizes us nowadays would be the culture very visibly displayed in the architecture, the decorative arts, fashion, and most of all, the cuisine.” \n\n“Our food incorporates coconut milk, belacan—which is this fermented shrimp paste, chili, spices, and all the ingredients from the local environment. It’s not something that you’d have in a quintessential Chinese cuisine. We had our own etiquette and customs.”\n\n“There was a precedence in who ate first [during Tok Panjang.] Senior family members, they ate first. Then after they got up, we would replenish the food and the next round of guests would sit. This went on for three or four shifts. It would have started around 11:30 and by about 2:30, it would be over.” \n\n“It’s getting more and more rare. Not everybody would have that strength or stamina to cook ten dishes. There was once or twice where we did it potluck style where each of us brought maybe three dishes out of the ten that my mom made. It’s quite remarkable that in my mom’s generation, these ladies did what they did.” \n\n“I think practice makes progress.

  "“Pandemics throughout history have forced humans to break with the past and imagine the world anew,” says writer Arundhati Roy. “It is a portal, a gateway between one world and the next.” \n\nFor Rhea and Marcel Michel of @saucychickrotisserie, being furloughed from their corporate jobs last year inspired them to try out an idea they’d been harboring for years: a rotisserie chicken concept that combined both their Mexican and Indian heritage.\n\n“If we were never furloughed from our jobs, I don’t know if Saucy Chick Rotisserie would be alive,” Rhea says. “I think it would still be a vision. I think as we get caught up in life and work and family, it’s sometimes a challenge to pursue dreams.”\n“Anyone that starts something new, especially something like food, you’re now finding yourself with new connections, new meaning. What was important to me about Saucy Chick is it ignited the conversation of, ‘What does representation look like? What does legacy look like?’”\n\n“I’m an immigrant to refugees, Marcel is first-generation, and we think about food being an artifact of culture, and how culture evolves over time and generations.”\n\n“I think what this menu does for us is showcase Marcel’s mom’s beans, the Jeera chicken showcases my dad, rotisserie chicken [is] an item that is very significant in American culture—so it’s a way to become a part of the tapestry of the cities that we’ve lived in.”\n\n🎧 More #GoodFoodInTheWeeds with Rhea and Marcel in our latest episode \n📷 @saucychickrotisserie",

Across West African culture, the dough-like starch staple is used as a personalized utensil, woven into the lives and stories of families. \n\n“When you eat fufu and soup, you're stepping into history, experiencing a rich cultural heritage,” writes Ukegbu in her new book 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗔𝗿𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗙𝘂𝗳𝘂.\n\n“Fufu usually is eaten with a hearty vegetable soup,” Ukegbu says. “It can be a vegetable from melon seed, mango seed, okazi, spinach, peanut soup. And it can stem from Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon, Senegal, Liberia. And the soup is, the majority of the time, vegan.”\n\n“The proper food etiquette when eating fufu is to wash your hands in a basin bowl. Most of the time, you can kind of tell who is not familiar with fufu if they bring out the cutlery to eat it. So as a child, you are pretty much eating with your hands, which is fun.”\n\n“With [the] book, a lot of people who were not raised on this soup are actually taking the initiative and really understanding more about West African food, and especially the African diaspora. Our parents were so busy making a living for us that they didn't really give us time to actually learn how to make the soups.

Just four ingredients—flour, water, salt and yeast—perform differently in the hands of each baker. \n\nArturo Enciso’s story may have begun with a wood-fired cob oven and loaf of sourdough, but these days the racks at @gustobread are lined with conchas, and the smell of masa lingers in the air. Together with his partner Ana Salatino, they share their story from backyard cottage bakery to Long Beach panaderia.\n\n“When I would bake everything myself and go sell it at the market, I took a lot of pleasure in that,” Enciso shares. “I would love talking about what we were making and the stories behind it. It was definitely exhausting some days, but being able to hand someone a fresh bread that I worked so hard at, and just the smile on their face—telling me how they were going to eat it, who they’d share it with—it just gave me energy.”\n\n“The more I did a lot of the French things, it just didn’t feel like me. So I felt like, you know what? I’m gonna use my knowledge to apply to the breads I grew up with. Using sourdough [for] conchas and other pan dulces that we were working on, I developed a menu as well as drinks like horchata, cafe de olla.”\n\n“Nowadays, conchas and some pan dulces, unfortunately, at some major panaderias really sacrifice quality. So our culture, too, has been watered down. My dad probably grew up eating better bread than there is today.”\n\n“When we make our conchas, it’s what I like to imagine a concha was like 100 years ago.

It was too expensive for them.” \n\n“So we basically had to eat Korean food all the time, and we hated having to eat Korean food all the time. We felt like it was just another area of difference between us and our friends—and society at large, if you will.” \n\n“But on the holidays, my parents would try to incorporate American recipes in our dinner. So a lot of our Thanksgiving dinners were very unusual. You’d see a roasted turkey in the middle, and then galbi on the side. Or yams, and then goguma, which are Korean sweet potatoes.” \n\n“It was a mish-mash of a lot of different things. And we kind of sustained that tradition of Korean and American Thanksgiving food for a very long time until finally, I think later on, a bunch of us kids were like, ‘Actually, we just really like Korean food.’ And then our Thanksgiving looked a lot more traditional Korean fare.”\n\n🎧 Hear about Thanksgiving in Igbo culture from @hikavachi, @diepette’s tips for fish sauce with turkey, @bryantterry’s secretly vegan potato salad, @thejamlab’s Indian take on Brussels sprouts + highlights from @kcrwevan and @genevieve_ko’s Q&A about all things cooking prep in our Thanksgiving Episode. \n\n📷 Jules Exum / Joanne Lee Molinaro",

And on March 15—it was a Sunday, and we served brunch—the electricity went out. We had just seated a few tables and had to refund everyone, cancel the rest of the remaining reservations, and then we just never opened for dinner.”\n\n“Then with the help of the first draw of the PPP loan, we reopened but just for takeout. We rejiggered our menu so that it would be more takeout-friendly. But we realized the end was coming sooner than anticipated. There was just no business. There was no takeout. Koreatown was so quiet. There were days where no orders would come in. And the funds were going away, so I thought the best thing to do was to put this beautiful restaurant to sleep.”\n\n“So we were forced to put it up for sale. It was a fair request. If there was a buyer, we would have to move forward with that sale. This was the most heartbreaking thing, I think, Jonathan and I have  been through.

After immigrating from Western India, she moved to the Bay Area from London, where she had a full life before becoming a chef. In celebration of Diwali, she shared her childhood memories around feasts to celebrate the five-day festival of lights, and how she realized her dream later in life of opening a restaurant.\n\n“This is my journey,” Patel says. “Through the beginning of my years, I had done what was expected from me. As a Gujarati, [in] my culture, there is no support to go outside the home or do what you’re good at. So I did not know where to start, how to do it. It took me a while to find the language and the ways to follow my own inspiration, my own dream.”\n\n“The kitchen—I look around, they’re all younger than me. Nobody is white-haired as me, nobody is older as me. But I felt like I wanted to do this for myself. So that’s the reason I called it Besharam. [It] reflects the bold and unedited version of me. Same goes to my life history living in India, going to London, coming here. The name means shameless, giving me freedom to cook what I think is Gujarati food to me.”\n\n“#Diwali is the most joyous five-day celebration. As a child growing up, those five days I had so much variety to eat and to choose from. I come from a middle-class family. I never went out to eat because we could not afford. Everything [was] made at home. What I remember is my mom gathered with my aunts, the neighbors, all together to make these sweet and savory treats.

Our hope is to drive people back to Chinatown to the businesses that still exist, especially the legacy businesses. We hope to be a face of the next generation that cares and appreciates the first generation.”\n\n“COVID really challenged us but it caused us to evaluate and consider our values and priorities as a business. I think what’s interesting is that COVID really caused us to recognize our brand as something that really is tied to our identity and to ourselves. It’s our stories and our identities that really build a brand.”\n\n“I think us operating in Chinatown, serving drinks like the five spice latte—it’s a way to show those that are around us that we’re proud of who we are and where we come from.

Bread is treated differently across China, from the soft milk bread to mo, which looks and cooks like an English muffin. \n\nKristina Cho began her career as an architect, but turned her love of both the sweet and savory pastries into her blog @eatchofood, which has given rise to a new cookbook, MOONCAKES AND MILK BREAD.\n\n“I’ve always just in general been obsessed with food,” Cho says. “I grew up in a restaurant family—my grandparents owned Chinese restaurants so I would spend my afternoons after school there. And I was surrounded by amazing cooks, but we did not have a lot of bakers.”\n\n“I later found out while I was writing the book that my grandpa always had dreams of becoming a baker, but he just wasn’t really good at it other than making his almond cookies. But my own passion of baking kind of developed out of that void of not having any home bakers around me.”\n\n“When I was in middle school, I was very obsessed with watching Food Network and collecting library books and teaching myself how to make from scratch cookies and brownies and cakes and pastries. So I’m very much a self-taught baker but I think because I have an architectural mind, it sort of lends itself to how bakers and pastry people approach their recipes.”\n\n🎧 More with @eatchofood on the latest episode on @kcrw or wherever you get your podcasts\n📷 Kristina Cho / Courtesy of Harper Horizon",
  "Huitlacoche has long been considered a delicacy in Mexico, but in the U.S. it goes by the unfortunate name of corn smut, or corn fungus. When it showed up last week at the @smfms, chefs and home cooks gathered around @mcgrathfamilyfarmers stand to marvel at the sight. \n\n\"In my farming career it was the most talked about item we've ever had here at McGrath,\" says farmer Mike Roberts.

As adults, they each moved to Los Angeles, exploring the city and its food scene before they partnered to open @luv2eat.thaibistro in 2014. Almost immediately, they developed a following for their fiery crab curry and warm hospitality. \n\n“We wanted to come here together, but I came first and then she followed me,” Kaewtathip says. “We have [the] same passion about cooking. We wanted to cook some southern Thai dishes that we have, like our own recipes. We just want to let people know more about Thai food.”\n\n“[When I was] thinking about what I want to cook, I was thinking about my mom’s crab curry, because here, I didn't see crab curry in another restaurant,” Pla explains. “It uses fresh crab and coconut milk and has a chili paste homemade. This one is very good—my favorite dish that I want to cook here when I opened the restaurant.”\n\n“When they announced that we have to close for dining, we tried to think a lot, ‘What should we do?’ shares Kaewtathip. ”Because it's gonna change everything. For me, I [thought] like, ‘How can I cut the cost? How can I control the costs? How can we make us survive?’”\n\n“And we are so lucky. We have really lovely customers who [are] always supporting us and helping us. I never expected that we're going to have this kind of problem before.

And the city seemed to be working with us. There were figures going back and forth. Then COVID hit. Everything naturally went into shutdown mode and we heard nothing. In May of 2021, we received a letter from the City Attorney Mike Feuer saying that because you have not granted us access to evaluate your inventory and look at your plants, we are now offering you nothing.” \n\n“We would just like to be treated fairly,” Maria says. “We are three women—my two sisters and I own the business. We’re three Latinas. We’ve always struggled through 67 years. We want to continue our business. We want to continue feeding our community. We want to continue employing people from the community.

Instead of one chef overseeing [everything], there were two. And two in pastry.

  "Most entrepreneurs will tell you they don’t want to be like anybody else in the market, but Beny Ashburn and Teo Hunter are hoping to start a revolution. They’re the owners of @crownsandhops, one of the few Black-owned breweries in the country. This summer, they launched an equity crowdfunding campaign to build their own brick-and-mortar facility in Inglewood. \n\n“When we first started in the craft beer industry about six, seven years ago, our focus was primarily to introduce and showcase what Black and Brown culture looked like in craft beer,” Beny says. \n\n“As we started to visit many of these breweries and noticed that there were no people of color, we took it upon ourselves to create those spaces for people of color. Through content and curated experiences in locations where we knew we could galvanize our community via barbershops or clothing stores or sneaker shops, we started to introduce craft beer to the market in a way that just wasn’t done before.”\n\n“I didn’t know about craft beer,” Teo explains. “No one had introduced it to me. The circles that I was personally involved in didn’t celebrate craft beer. So naturally it caused me to do a deep dive into it to later understand that the industry itself had an issue with being diverse, with being inclusive.” \n\n“In the hardships of COVID, a lot of opportunity presented itself for the Black community in terms of entrepreneurship,” Ashburn adds. “And the mission that myself and Teo have been focused on—getting rid of this lack of diversity, creating more racial equity inside of an industry—people started really hearing what we were saying. Because we were a brand that was very focused on change.”\n\n“To have the first Black-owned brewing company in Inglewood, CA, we need the investment of the community—not just the community of Inglewood, but the craft beer community—who understands the significance of what we’re doing,” Hunter notes. “This is bigger than beer. This is about ownership. This is about racial equity.”\n\n🎧 More #GoodFoodInTheWeeds with @benyashburn and @teo_hunter in our latest episode on @kcrw\n📷 @crownsandhops",
  "Maria Del Socorro Vazquez and Zacil Vazquez are living out their wildest dreams. When they came to the United States, they worked as street food vendors since Zacil was a kid. But years after she made a promise to her mom that one day she’d have her own restaurant, the mother-daughter duo opened Sazón in Huntington Park in July. \n\n“Sazón is an ode to my mother’s cooking which is a hybrid of Guerrero, Mexico, as well as Yucatán, Mexico,” Zacil shares. “It’s a beautiful hybrid of home and street food.”\n\n“My mom started selling food when she was 35 years old or so. I was still a kid. And she did it because upon coming to the United States, she ended up being a single mother who had to work multiple jobs to make ends meet. She worked as a housekeeper and when she saw that that wasn’t rendering enough to be able to cover food and rent, she decided to become an entrepreneur.”\n\n“My mom was doing street vending by herself and obviously she would get tired. And as her only daughter here, it was my duty to help her. So she would bring me along. When kids would pass by, especially kids from my school, I would feel ashamed that we were selling food on the corners of the neighborhoods that we lived in.”\n\n“But in retrospect, I’m very proud of the experiences that my mom and I went through because they have made me the person I am today. They have made me more compassionate, more understanding, and more willing to do right by all of the workers that we employ, but also all of the street vendors throughout Los Angeles and beyond.”\n\n“I made a promise to my mom at ten years old that one day we wouldn’t have to be selling food on the streets. I saw firsthand how hard we had to work, how much prep time went in to making the foods that we sold, and how little money we made with all the time that went into street vending. And even as a child I knew that my mom and I deserved better.\"\n\n“When we made her that promise, it was so unbelievable to her. She didn’t think it was possible as the times went on and the years felt eternal.

  "When you lose your sense of taste or smell due to COVID-19, it can manifest in different ways. You can have total loss, or you can suffer from abnormalities like phantosmia—when you smell things that aren’t really there, like an odorous hallucination. The most terrifying part is not knowing when, if ever, the sense of smell will return. \n\n“Anosmia is when you lose your sense of smell completely,” explains Dr. Nancy Rawson, a scientist at the Monell Institute of Smell in Philadelphia. “Parosmia happens when there’s an odor present, but your brain recognizes it as something different than what it is. For whatever reason, the different thing the brain picks is usually something that’s very unpleasant. So coffee will smell like gasoline fumes.”\n\nWe talked people who who shared their personal stories of when they realized it was happening to them. \n\n“It’s like my entire world flipped upside down,” Sakeenah Benjamin says. “Nothing tastes right, nothing smells right. I’ll smell rancid meat when I smell garlic, or I’ll smell garbage when I smell fried chicken.”\n\n“It’s really shown me that the super simple things in life can just be easily taken away. It’s like a light switch is turned off in my brain and it’s like I’m waiting for it to come back on.”\n\n“It’s affected relationships and family because our common—how we interact—is through food.

  "Bulgogi, galbi, and pork belly are the cornerstones of Korean barbecue with the accompanying cluster of banchan. But how do you make the concept work during the pandemic when communal cooking on a tabletop grill is the center of everything?\n\nTucked into a strip mall on South Vermont, @parksbbq in the heart of Koreatown has been at it for nearly two decades. Recognized by the @beardfoundation for Outstanding Service in 2018, Chef Jenee Kim opened the restaurant in 2003 while raising two small kids with a meat-specialty concept she hoped Koreans would recognize. \n\n“I was brave because I was a mom,” Kim recalls. “I didn’t come from a culinary background but after college, I got into really cooking seriously. I often hosted dinner parties for my friends who were also missing home food when we were students in Philadelphia before I came to LA.”\n\n“I opened Parks BBQ in 2003. It was so hard to survive at that time. I put everything in I had and really put my future on this. When I moved to LA, I just moved with my two children. It was really scary and stressful but I was brave.”\n\n“At the beginning, most customers were Korean. At that time there were not very many Korean restaurants in K-Town. I just tried to do a beef specialty BBQ restaurant which was the only one in LA.”\n\n“Most everything we serve is my home recipe and something I eat myself on a daily basis. For side dishes, we try to change it seasonally and daily. We’re also famous for galbitang and stone pot rice. We have three different kinds of stone pot rice.”\n\n“March 15, 2020, we were ordered to shut down. I was so scared [for] what was going to happen and what was happening. My management team was so great, encouraging each other, supporting any way we could for our staff. We gave them all the vacation pay. And got all this toilet paper, rice, ramyun, whatever so our staff could survive through this time. When I was looking at my staff, everybody was so scared. I just can’t forget their faces.”\n\n“Seeing my regular customers was amazing. Oh my god, it was so nice to see them. We were about to hug and cry to each other. It’s so nice to be back.”\n\n🎧 More #GoodFoodInTheWeeds in our latest on @kcrw\n📷 @parksbbq",

Fans of the duo can now make their dishes pulling on memories with Palestinian, Moroccan, Egyptian, and Israeli flavors at home from their eponymous new cookbook, BAVEL. \n\n“My dad was Egyptian so it really felt right to open a Middle Eastern restaurant,” Genevieve shares. “When Ori cooks, it’s all these memories of my father. Where the Italian food is delicious that he makes, it didn’t feel like home to me where the food that Ori makes [at Bavel] just feels like home. I pulled on the desserts from scents and flavors of things I grew up with on my dad’s side using bases of sweet cheeses with pastry and dried fruits and nuts and spices.” \n\nMany of Bavel’s complex and comforting dishes are vegetarian-friendly, from confited okra to mushroom kebabs.\n\n“This goes back to childhood when I would go into my favorite restaurants with my family and the first thing that hits the table are 24 different mezze plates,” Ori explains. “And none of them have meat, all of them are vegetarian. It’s a cuisine that’s based on lots of vegetables and the main course would be a leg of lamb or something that goes well with all the leftovers that you have on the table from the beginning of the meal.”\n\n🥘 Check our story☝🏼for the recipes \n🎧 More with @ChefOri and Genevieve on @kcrw\n📷 @nicole_franzen / @baveldtla",

  "Born into a family of farmers in Fresno, journalist Mark Arax paints a vivid and complex portrait of California and its water, having witnessed firsthand the cyclical nature of droughts and floods in the state. In his 2019 book THE DREAMT LAND, he says that in California, “drought isn’t nature, drought is man.” \n\n“That is the whole ethos of the people who live here—that drought is something that can be manipulated,” Arax says. “That it's not something that nature imposes upon us, but it's somehow our failing to be able to conquer nature. You can understand why we have that feeling, because we invented the greatest water moving hydraulic system in the history of man. So we thought we could conquer nature. And we did a pretty good job of it for 75 years.”\n\n“But the system is cracking. There are too many demands we're putting on it. This is the story. We just came out of a historic drought not that long ago. We find ourselves back in another one. And we find ourselves as discombobulated by this one as we were by the last one.”\n\n“And we're seeing things we’ve never seen before. Drought reveals all lies. The way we're growing is a lie. It cannot be sustained.”\n\n“California has gone from 13 million people to 40 million. We need to have a conversation about how much more we can grow.” \n\n“We have added tens of thousands of acres of new fruit and nut trees in the Central Valley since the last drought.

It’s a husband and wife with a small child at a stall in Grand Central Market selling beautiful banchan and doshirak.”\n\n“The name [is] a reference to the fact that Kwang and Mina have started their own family and also that they think of themselves very much as part of a larger community. Not just the Grand Central Market community of stalls, but the larger Los Angeles community.”\n\n“Part of the reason that I jumped back into reviewing weekly with Shiku is that a lot of Angelenos who weren’t as familiar with very portable Korean dishes learned about doshiraks during the pandemic’s darkest days.

Just a few decades ago, tobacco provided a secure income for Southern farmers.

The thing that really kind of got me into it was the fact when [my grandfather] found out that he had cancer, he said he wanted me to farm. And I was just old enough to remember him saying, ‘Whatever you do, you carry this farm. One day you need to carry. You need to be able to operate it for your family to survive. And that's my wish.’ \n\n“I have two sons, the oldest being 21, and the youngest being eight.

We kind of translated that with Stephen and he was sort of taking the metaphorical journey through her book and it became his journey.” \n\n“So often in the West and in the United States in particular, part of the way our culture has been erased is through our food,” Satterfield explains. “And our story of food is so singular, oftentimes so myopic, coming through this particular African American purview of soul food, that it really has kind of erased our cultural contributions and also our ancestral food.”\n\n“And that ancestral food is really what ties us to our health, to our agency, to our traditions. And so for me, it was really just the ability to see and taste so many flavors and ingredients that were in a sense both unfamiliar and, in other ways, connected me to this ancestral, culinary tradition.”\n\n“I think that this moment as exemplified by High on the Hog at large is really, in my mind, a reclamation project. A really essential and timely one at that. We tend to only understand Black food through this extremely narrow lens of soul food.”\n\n“As Michael Twitty says, we are the only people who name our food after a feeling. And that feeling and time and era was a moment of radicalization in taking power and taking pride. And, of course, food was an important part of that cultural moment as it is all cultural moments.” \n\n“I do appreciate the origins of both the phrase and the spirit that is underpinning it.

  "Los Angeles has reopened. Restaurants are full, bar seating has returned, and @latimesfood critic @bill_addison is back on the beat scanning QR codes and sharing his restaurant reviews for us to look forward to dining in again. \n\nHe began with @phenakite.la, the LA Times Restaurant of the Year. \n\n“Minh Phan is the chef and owner of @porridgeandpuffs, a very beloved figure in Los Angeles,” Bill says. “Back in September, she launched into this project. It's a fine dining integration of the food that Minh has been cooking for years.”\n\n“She comes from a Vietnamese family, but she's very quick to say that she cooks Angeleno food, that it reflects everything that she encounters and eats herself in the city. And it's a really special experience.”\n\n“Some things on my radar: @menya_tigre on Sawtelle is doing a curry ramen bowl that I'm hearing really good things about. \n\nI’m thinking of Holbox in the Mercado La Paloma in South LA, a place where you can always get beautiful carry out.\n\nI'm really enthralled right now with a pop-up called @LittleDacha specializing in Russian foods and Circassian culture. \n\n@chachacha.la in the Arts District has this incredible rooftop patio up a flight of stairs overlooking the Downtown skyline.”\n\n“I think what a lot of us have missed most when it comes to really connecting with dining experiences is sitting at the counter or at the bar. I'm thinking of @petitepeso, the Downtown restaurant opened by @riadollybarbosa and her partners. I can't wait to sit at that tiny counter in that small space. I'm probably gonna have a longanisa breakfast burrito at that counter before the month is over.”\n\n🎧 More of Bill’s thoughts on the latest episode on @kcrw \n📷 @dania_maxwell for @latimes",
  "Barbecue is an obsessive craft. Ask Andrew Muñoz, whose obsession with barbecue started as a hobby, blossomed into a backyard pop-up, and has now become a full-blown business with his wife and co-owner Michelle. Moo’s is about to open their first brick and mortar in Lincoln Heights. \n\n“I found my way to barbecue through my day job,” Andrew shares. “I used to report in to Texas a few times a quarter. In my off-time, I would explore the city and my father-in-law always told me if I was ever in Texas, to try the barbecue. I did, and I was instantly hooked.”\n\n“I would barbecue in my backyard just to hang out and clear my mind, and over time, we started getting a little bit better, and I just wanted to cook every weekend.”\n\n“I thought he was crazy obsessed with it, but at the same time I was intrigued,” Michelle says. “And I wanted to learn more about it.”\n\n“My wife came up with this idea of starting a pop-up in the backyard. Fast forward a couple of years, we had a pretty good following. It was very consuming and we had to decide if we were going to pursue this or say that it was a fun thing that we did.” \n\n“I happened to get laid off at the same time as we were making that decision so that made it easier for us. I [didn’t] want to stay in the corporate world. [We thought], let’s try this and if it doesn’t work out, we’ll go back to what we were doing. Thankfully it’s worked out for us.”\n\n“We’re born and raised Angelenos so we like to bring that Cali-Mex twist to our menu,” Michelle explains. “And that’s where we bring something a little different than just your traditional Texas-style barbecue.”\n\n“A lot of the recipes include a lot of Mexican influence—Mexican herbs and dried chiles and fire-roasted poblanos. Our esquites are our take on a traditional creamed corn. It’s the creamed corn that we grew up eating on the streets of Los Angeles, that we enjoyed hearing the paletero coming down the street honking his horn. We wanted to incorporate that into our menu.”\n\n“Everything is served family style and on a tray. It’s meant to be shared with family and friends. Try a little bit of everything.”\n\n🎧 More #GoodFoodInTheWeeds on @kcrw\n📷 @mooscraftbarbecue",
  "The pandemic has given us the time and distance to think more deeply about the idea of #hospitality. After the loss of what we think of as traditional restaurant hospitality, many of us spent a year trying to be hospitable to ourselves or those closest to us.\n\nIn her thought-provoking book BE MY GUEST, Priya Basil explores the meaning of generosity through the lens of food and beyond.\n\n“I was so intrigued about the roots of hospitality when I was researching for this book from an Indo-European word which meant host, guest, and stranger simultaneously,” Basil shares. “I thought that this trio of words was so powerful and interesting because it seems to me that those are the three roles through which we move consciously or unconsciously throughout our lives.” \n\n“I think the hospitality that we get from our parents, if we’re lucky, is like no other that we experience in any parts of our lives. And as my mother gets older and has been unwell in various ways, it was suddenly so vivid to me that something was changing, and that this was a natural part of life. That we are no longer offered the care that we always expected, but that a certain care is demanded of us in turn. This shift from being a guest to being a host is one of the hallmarks of growing up and of reaching maturity. To take care instead of being taken care of.” \n\nAs the economy reopens here in Los Angeles, it’s important to remember our part as guests in this exchange.\n\n“This notion of reciprocity under this umbrella of hospitality is really important. Even if we are paying for something, we have a responsibility to honor the other person, to take care of them, to be aware of their needs.”\n\n“In this pandemic time, this question of what our role is in showing consideration to others, it has a different charge. Keeping the right distance, wearing a mask—all of these things to me have become expressions of hospitality.”\n\n“So for me this question of giving and giving up—host and guest and stranger—they’re all related. It’s shifting roles and responsibilities that are a part of how we can live together better.” \n\n🎧 More in the latest episode on @kcrw\n📷 Courtesy of CC BY 2.0 (@the_imf) & Knopf",

  "In his latest book, BLACK SMOKE: AFRICAN AMERICANS AND THE UNITED STATES OF BARBECUE, food scholar and James Beard winner Adrian Miller writes that, “Black-run barbecue joints often find themselves located at the intersection of food, race, and absurdity.”\n\n“Barbecue was one of the places where people kind of ignored the color line in terms of restaurants, and you would often find whites going into the Black neighborhood to get barbecue,” he says. \n\n“What surprised me in researching this book is that Native Americans were the first barbecue cooks, really, and that they were enslaved as well. So the earliest forms of barbecue were probably cooked by enslaved Native Americans and white indentured servants before the transition to African slavery.”\n\n“So then, when Africans are enslaved and asked to cook this way, they start to meld their own kind of meat cooking and smoking traditions from West Africa with European grilling techniques and what Native Americans were doing, and it becomes this kind of unique thing.” \n\n“A lot of people in the time of colonial America called barbecue ‘cooking the Indian way.’ And what you find is there are some African American barbecuers well into the 20th century who still described this kind of old school barbecue as ‘cooking the Indian way.’ \n\n“And that was digging a trench a few feet wide, a few feet deep, filling it with hardwood coals that were burned down, and then taking whole animal carcasses—that could be a pig, sheep, if they get a cow—butterflying them and sticking poles in the side of them.”\n\n“And then somebody flipped those carcasses regularly to cook them without burning, and then added sauce throughout the process. And so that was what Southern barbecue was originally.”\n\n“On the plantations, enslaved African Americans also used barbecue to build church in a very small sense. Usually enslaved people had the weekends off, especially the Sabbath. And with the work schedule slowed, that gave time to barbecue. And so you get this connection to church and barbecue.”\n\n🎧 More with @soulfoodscholar in the latest episode\n📷 Courtesy of University of North Carolina Press",
  "Animator Elizabeth Ito is the Los Angeles-born, fourth-generation Japanese American creator of CITY OF GHOSTS, a six-episode kids’ series on @netflix about a team of child sleuths who traverse diverse neighborhoods of LA and encounter supernatural beings and their stories—with a bunch of restaurants along the way. \n\nTrusting little humans to carry big ideas like honoring your ancestors and the history of internment camps, the show is voiced by real people like @chefkuniko and @isafabro that creates a love letter to a real version of Los Angeles. The kind where if somebody says to you, “I hate LA,” you can tell them to watch it because they’re not doing it right.\n\n“The premise is that a little boy is making a documentary about his sister who has a ghost club where they go around Los Angeles neighborhoods to look for ghosts to tell them why they’re haunting people,” Ito explains. “And basically through that, Zelda and her ghost club friends all learn about the city and the different communities that are within LA.”\n\n“When I was a kid, I lived in the Crenshaw area and that’s where my family still lives—my mom, my dad, and brother. And then my mom was a teacher on the Westside of LA. My grandparents lived in Culver City, for a while they lived in Mid-City, and I also had grandparents that lived in West Adams. So it was kind of all over.”\n\n“One of the big factors was thinking about how my dad grew up in East LA. During the holidays they always go to get tamales from a bakery that he likes in East LA and I asked him, ‘Do you feel like being around other cultures influenced this decision that we do every year?’ And he was kind of like, ‘No, it was just what people did around there.’”\n\n“But it was really revealing to me in a way where I feel like a lot of people from LA connect that way. You don’t necessarily attribute everything that you do to the different cultures that have affected you but definitely it does influence what you eat and what things are kind of regular for you so I think it’s sort of ingrained in overlapping cultures that we share food. So a lot of [the episodes] did center around restaurants.” \n\n🎧 More with @ottersnaps on @kcrw\n📷 @netflix",

  "Pivot, pivot, and then pivot again. That’s been the theme for many restaurants this past year. \n\nChef/owner Chris Yang had a neighborhood darling on his hands when Yang’s Kitchen opened in 2019. Despite its popularity and accolades, the costs of labor and the price of ingredients barely let them break even. And then there was the pandemic. \n\n“We knew that we were opening in the #SanGabrielValley which had a lot of really, really affordable mom and pop Asian restaurants,” Yang explains.\n\n“And we told ourselves when we were coming in, based on our price point, we had to differentiate ourselves. We were really deliberate about that with the communication of our menu—pointing out farmers, producers, and suppliers that we sourced from to signal to people we’re trying to do something different here.”\n\n“I’m not sure where the perception that Chinese food should be cheap came from. I think a lot of it is when Asians themselves think of home and all the delicious foods that they ate at home. Oftentimes [in] Asia, Hong Kong, China, or even Taiwan, you can find foods for like $2, $3 USD on the street. And I think that kind of skews a lot of people’s perspectives.”\n\n“But overhead is different over there. Labor is different over there. The taxes, food costs, everything is different. So it’s really apples to oranges. And when you come to America, maybe people bring that perception back with them. But I don’t see that as the case, that Chinese food should be cheap.”\n\n“When Governor Newsom announced the shutdowns, our business at the time was already struggling because we were trying to reach profitability but were having a hard time managing that.”\n\n“COVID caused us to pivot four or five times, but after the second, we kind of looked at it more as experiments and gathering data. Seeing what we could do, seeing what works for the business. It’s really tiring and stressful, but this is probably the best time to experiment with the restaurant.”\n\n🎧 More #GoodFoodInTheWeeds on @kcrw",
  "Master gardener Alyssa Kahn asserts that wild mustard has a complicated history of how it made its way to California as a threat to native plants. Khan and Nadine Allan—who illustrated everything—created the free online zine WILD MUSTARD: A GUIDE IN THE AGE OF WILDFIRES with tips on putting it to use at home beyond a condiment.\n\n“Mustard has a complicated history as far as how it got here and what it’s doing now, which is really threatening biodiversity and out-competing California natives,” Khan explains. “Mustard produces chemicals that inhibit seed germination in the wake of fire damage. And then once dry, the mustard becomes tinder for wildfires.”\n\n“The main threat is that mustard is an annual plant so it dries up at the end of the season. When it’s dry and just has proliferated everywhere, it can easily catch on fire. And that fire can spread.”\n\n“When I look at mustard, I think of all the ways it could be put to use rather than sitting around to become dry and turn into tinder for wildfires.”\n\n“There are many types of wild mustards, but the one that we mainly see around is the black mustard. You can tell by its yellow flowers that have four petals on them.”\n\n“One of the home uses for mustard is to make a powder which can act as a dish washer or a deodorizer to get rid of the odors from food residues. Use the seeds and grind them out. You can use an electric coffee grinder or a mortar and pestle.”\n\n“Mustard has really strong cellulose fibers so we are able to make paper out of it using a mold and a deckle—a frame with a fine mesh screen inside of it. The paper is a little pulpy, a little bit thick, and the color is kind of a washed-out green.”\n\n“It’s not too difficult [to make an ink]. You just need some mustard flowers as well as its brown seeds, water, vinegar, salt, and gum arabic.” \n\n“If you have a lot of mustard, you can rub it between your hands or against a surface that will cause the seed pods to break open. From there, you do the screen process.” \n\n💻 Visit naynay.co/mustard for the full zine guide to the practical wonders of mustard. 🌾\n\n🎧 More on our latest episode on @kcrw\n📷 Courtesy of Alyssa Kahn + Nadine Allan",
  "Mother knows best, or so the old adage goes. During the pandemic, @nytimes Food + @nytcooking writer @ericjoonho returned home to Atlanta to ask for his mother’s help on a chapter he was writing for his cookbook KOREAN AMERICAN. \n\nLittle did he know that he would unearth a treasure trove of ingredients and techniques that he took for granted when he ate her food as a child. And then a month-long trip turned into nine. \n\n“The pandemic was probably a big reason because I really wanted to be with my family and I missed them,” Kim shares. “But ultimately, I did have this book deal to write down my family recipes which are Korean recipes and also Korean American recipes.”\n\n“Ultimately, I knew that I had to be back there to really walk through my mother’s portions of the recipes because they require weeks and weeks of fermentation and a really close eye and visual cues. There are only so many things you can do over the phone. But a month long stay turned into nine months.” \n\n“It was a surprise to all of us but it was definitely a blessing in disguise. It wasn’t really in disguise, actually. It was a huge blessing.”\n\n“I thought I knew so much more about her cooking than I realized I did as I started actually cooking with her. And finding the details.”\n\n“One reason is I also love when food has balance. Not just salty and sour but also sweet. I also think it’s a nice feature of Korean flavors—balance is really important. I just assumed she used white sugar when I was growing up, but nope, she uses these syrups.”\n\n“I basically spent eight months reporting on my mother’s cooking and on my family’s past. It was lovely to sort of tease out of her why she in particular does certain things. To get her to think about things like why she puts pine nuts in her kimchi.” \n\n“Just to be clear, of course the reason the book deal happened is because I think my mom’s a genius. She’s always been that good cook. She’s always been known as the cook. You can take that for granted when you’re growing up with that food. But it’s not really ubiquitous to be good at cooking.”\n\n🎧 More on KOREAN AMERICAN + Eric’s @nytcooking story on @kcrwgoodfood \n📷 Courtesy of Eric Kim / @linda.xiao",
  "We’ve heard a lot of stories about spending time in the kitchen alongside mom, but imagine turning that sweet story into a business plan. Keegan Fong did just that. @woonkitchen in #HistoricFilipinotown is his collaboration with his mother Julie Chen Fong, aka Mama Fong. \n\n“The journey of opening Woon first started as a passion side project,” Keegan explains. “I would go home and want something to work on other than my day job. So I came up with a concept of my mom’s noodle shop and I would work on a business plan every night just to keep my wheels turning.” \n\n“I was involved in the beginning [of] the noodle pop-ups, but as far as having a restaurant, I was pretty skeptical,” says Mama Fong. “And I had reservations about it, but Keegan’s determination convinced me that it’s gonna be okay, that I could do it in a professional kitchen because I had always been a home cook. So that was a big leap for me.”\n\n“As a boy, Keegan would always come home and there was always food in the kitchen for him and his sister. Wherever mama is, there is food. So it’s a comfort thing for him.”\n\n“He’s always been a very good kid since day one but going to work with him is another story. And I admire him now because of his persistence and his intellectual side of the business that I’ve never seen before. I’m really proud of him. And I know him better than before and we’re kind of getting to know each other more and more.” \n\n“Prior to COVID, she was in the kitchen like 8 to 10 hours a day,” Keegan shares. “And I remember on March 13, we decided it would be her last day in the kitchen until it was safe again and little did we know that would be over a year later.”\n\n“When I first opened this restaurant, she had been diagnosed with breast cancer right after I signed the lease on this place. So she was coming from radiation going straight to the kitchen and training our staff. And she did it for me and she did it for Woon, which I will never forget.” \n\n“They’re my mom’s recipes and she’s very protective of them. And I try to respect that as much as possible because at the end of the day, I wouldn’t have Woon without mom.” \n\n🎧 More #GoodFoodInTheWeeds on @kcrw\n📷 @codyjaaames",
  "When Goya Foods’ CEO Robert Unanue came out in support of the Trump administration last year, many in the Latinx community felt betrayed and began looking elsewhere for their sazón. \n\nScott Hattis is one of four partners at @eatloisa who together blend their Dominican and Peruvian heritage and NYC roots to create a totally new sazón and adobo using organic ingredients. \n\n“Loisa is based off of a neighborhood in New York—the Lower East Side—and in Spanglish and in street signs there you’ll see ‘Loisaida,’” Hattis explains. “That’s where my wife and I lived and we thought it just elicited a feeling and emotion and the vibrancy we wanted to bring to this brand.”\n\n“Sazón and adobo are kind of your pantry staples in any Latin kitchen. Traditionally, sazón is a richer blend that you would cook deep into beans and rices and stewed dishes. We mix it with olive oil and spread it over veggies or tofu or fish. The adobo is your all-purpose Latin seasoning—sort of a salt replacement blend [or] as part of a marinade or dry rub.”\n\n“[Co-founder Kenny Luna and I] used to cook all the time and this idea came from those shared meals. Both of us have young children. And discussing how important these foods and flavors are in our home, but how we’re not going to serve what Goya is making to our families.”\n\n“That a company that big is continuing to sell something that is filled with fillers, artificial flavors and colors that have been tied to health issues, and that we were able to go create a business that had products that did not include those as two people is a testament to the fact that there’s a choice.”\n\n“The CEO spoke out in favor of Trump which is obviously a tense stance to take against a community of customers who have been quite adversely affected by that administration and its policies. I can say that in my home and with my family, it was an incredibly emotional moment. These are products that have been in my wife’s home her whole life and now my family and my home. And the memories around family get-togethers and holidays and her papi cooking his rice with all these products started to suddenly take on a different feeling.”\n\n🎧 More on @kcrw\n📷 @eatloisa",

  "A grocery store is a bedrock for a community—a place to buy a mix of fresh, frozen, canned, and packaged food to feed yourself or your family.  \n\nThere are 40,000 in the U.S., less than there were five years ago. Of those, approximately 2,000 are in LA County. 60 are in South Los Angeles, which has a population of over 1.3 million people.

It’s become normalized and accepted to just provide whatever in these neighborhoods.”\n\n“It’s not by chance, it’s not by mistake. I often tell people [that] a better term than #fooddesert is #foodapartheid because this is something that has been made by man. And the word desert implies that this is something that occurs naturally in nature. If you tell somebody there’s a desert, people are not going to feel very obligated or activated to fix it. They’re just gonna say, ‘Hey there’s no water here, let’s move somewhere else.’ But when you let somebody know it’s food apartheid, you give them agency to take charge over making a difference.” \n\n“SÜPRMARKT will be five in June.

Born from a pivot, Lasa’s Chase Valencia is back with Nico de Leon at Far East Plaza in Chinatown with a new concept that continues to celebrate the flavors they grew up with. \n\n“LASA was a chef-driven, ambitious Filipino American restaurant by my brother and I and we’ve been there since 2017,” Valencia shares. “When the pandemic hit, the restaurant went through a lot of changes and a lot of pivots. [It] wore the business down. We just wanted to survive and sustain and make it.”\n\n“Filipino rotisserie is quite special. It’s something that I experienced when I was in the Philippines a few years ago. When they pulled it out to the table for my uncle and I, what was crazy was the aromas. It was hot, it was humid, but it was just so perfect at that moment. Having some San Miguel beer, the cars in traffic buzzing by.” \n\n“It tasted so good, back home I wanted to see if I could replicate it. I took it to a family party, sliced it for everyone and they were just enamored with the flavors. And it stuck with me for a few years. I wanted to build up a concept around this idea. It was something unique. It was a point of view. And we wanted to share that.” \n\n“One thing I learned during this pandemic is: Lasa was a very special occasion type of restaurant where I would see a return guest maybe every few months. And I love connecting with my guests and building relationships with them, hanging out, catching up. But I wanted to create something more approachable, where my restaurant would be part of my guests’ weekly routine.”\n\n“With Lasita, I’ve been able to see that frequency, that consistency that I’ve been craving and enjoying and thriving off of. And that’s been very uplifting seeing the array of people coming through and the support that I’ve been getting.

  "If restaurant spaces have lineages, PETITE PESO is a third generation Filipino concept. After working for years for other people on their projects, executive chef and partner @RiaDollyBarbosa opened the restaurant a month into the pandemic. \n\n“We are a Filipino restaurant that touches on the traditional but veers towards the more progressive side of things as well,” Barbosa explains. “We initially were set to open for breakfast and lunch. Our area used to have a lot of foot traffic with a lot of the office folks and the jewelry stores. But after the shutdown, all of that foot traffic went away. After observing that, we decided to switch our menu to serving lunch and dinner. And we had to pivot and quickly create an all-day menu that would travel well.”\n\n“Filipino food to me always meant gatherings and celebrations. Every gathering always included food of some sort and it was always some venerable feast on the tables. Usually relatives would bring food even if you were hosting. People always brought something. Food was a way for us to nurture and support and really take care of each other.”\n\n“With Petite Peso, my partners and I had in mind to have French brasserie vibes but serve Filipino food. We call ourselves authentic, progressive, and approachable. We wanted to keep one foot in tradition—we certainly don’t want to forget about where we came from and what we have experienced in our past.” \n\n“Filipinos, for the longest time, it feels like we’ve been really good at adapting to our circumstances around us. With a lot of Asian cultures, you want to blend in, you don’t really want to stir the pot. I think that for myself and with a lot of other younger Filipino cooks and chefs, we want to push our food forward. And while it may not look like something my mom or my grandmother made, it certainly will remind you of those flavors and move us further into the future. While it doesn’t exactly look like the same thing my parents made while growing up, the flavor is still there but it’s that texture that kind of makes you perk up and think twice about the dish itself.”\n\n🎧 More of #GoodFoodInTheWeeds on @kcrw or wherever you get your podcasts\n📷: Courtesy of @petitepeso",

Jeremy Konner and Erika Thormahlen are the creators of the new series. \n\n“In this new world of food entertainment, we thought, ‘What if we brought that into the kids space?’” Konner explains. “And really went with that.” \n\n“We wanted our characters to have a real curiosity but very little knowledge about food,” says Thormahlen. “We wanted them to be kind of alien to our whole planet. We didn’t want to specify a country they could be from. We wanted them to be new to all the countries on the globe.” \n\n“Kids don’t know food,” she adds. “It’s new to them. It can be exciting, sometimes it can be scary. So through Waffles + Mochi’s eyes and also their tastebuds, our audience gets to experience those first flavors, those first tastes.”\n\nBut it deals with education as well. Culinary historian Michael Twitty (@thecookinggene) talks about difficult truths that tether the origins of rice to the history of slavery. \n\n“That was definitely the most moving part of our filming experience,” Konner shares. “It was a complicated moment to figure out [if] we [were] going to talk about this. We really think that this is some of the most important stuff that we’re talking about on the show. Where our food comes from is complicated and we didn’t want to shy away from that.”\n\n🎧 More of this conversation in our latest episode on @kcrw or wherever you get your podcasts.\n📷: Adam Rose (@adams_photo_mojo)",
  "When the pandemic shut down businesses last March, Saehee Cho launched Soon Mini, a community-driven food subscription service to support local farms and small business owners. The money she collects goes toward social justice organizations, including @advancingjustice_aajc and @blackvisionscollective. Cho talks about the importance of “living horizontally”—involving herself in food, the arts, and activism.\n\n“The week everything shut down, I was just delivering complete meals to friends,” Saehee explains. “It expanded out to basically start carrying third-party items [from] specialty cooks, specialty bakers who had essentially been laid off their restaurant jobs and needed a new venture. Which oddly did this thing where it pushed especially women to create new small businesses.“\n\n“Supporting those small businesses in tandem with the farms have developed this community that’s really like-minded and really focused on not only spending money but every dollar is doing more than just consuming. This community is interested in making their money work for more than them.”\n\n“During the pandemic, obviously during Black Lives Matter, during this current crisis with the Asian American community, people are really activated to do more. And food being so universal—so essential—it becomes a really easy hubbing point for people to activate around.” \n\n“So thinking about a food model as not only a grocery delivery service, a way to provide food, but to think of it as a way to activate people to build community. People were more generous. It created this holistic sense of, ‘We’re all in it together.’ The vehicle for that is food, and it makes so much sense that it would be because it’s the unifier in all of these things.”\n\n“Food is generous the way poetry is generous, the way art is generous. These things are all in the same family for me. From a macro level, from an immigrant family, I think this is true of a lot of cultures: The table is where we commune. Where language lacks, where culture lacks, where common experience lacks — food bridges that gap.”\n\n🎧 More in our #AAPIGoodFood episode on @kcrw or wherever you get podcasts.\n📷: Justin Chung",
  "Lien Ta, the restaurateur behind @alldaybaby and co-founder of @regardingherfood grew up in nail salons operated by her mother, who worked for tips. In the wake of the Atlanta shootings that killed six Asian women, Lien had a realization: “That could have been my mom, my auntie.” Decades later as a small business owner herself, she grapples with questions such as, “How do we change the hospitality industry so workers are valued?” and, “Does anyone even want to work in restaurants anymore?”\n\n“I have been thinking a lot about the value of labor,” Ta explains. “I love restaurants, I love the work that we do in spite of how hard it is. But I would really love in my own small amount of power to reinstate the value of a restaurant worker, even a restaurant owner.”\n\n“I watched [my mom] work for tips my whole life and it was based on how great of a job she was gonna do whether she was going to receive $0 in tip or $5, $10, or $20.”\n\n“My mom owned many, many salons throughout my time of growing up. It was challenging. You’re a teenager and you see your mom just hovered over a set of hands all day long. And I’ve shared that I’m ashamed to admit that it was embarrassing to me to see my mom do that kind of work. And now, to come full circle, I think she’s embarrassed by me being in the restaurant industry.”\n\n“In hindsight I understand now that we both are in this line of service, servitude. And it’s hard work. And it’s not a lot of payoff. And she wondered, probably, why in the world did she work this hard [for me to] go and open a restaurant? Things that her family members did in Vietnam.”\n\n“I would love to see some really meaningful change in how we value our workers. It crosses my mind every single day to pay our workers more. And I think any kind of non-restaurant worker is like, ‘Well why don’t you?’ There’s just no money. We need help. We need new legislation to not only provide minimum wage but it needs to not be coupled with this tipping situation too. There needs to be something that works better for the restaurant industry.” \n\n🎧 More in our special #AAPIGoodFood episode hosted by @tongsonator of @uscdornsife on @kcrw or wherever you get your podcasts.\n📷: Joyce Kim",
  "In response to the hate and the horror in the escalating violence against the AAPI community, Professor Karen Tongson guest hosted this weekend’s episode of Good Food, asking several women to share their stories about race and gender and how they intersect with food and hospitality. @tongsonator chairs the Department of Gender and Sexuality Studies at USC, where she teaches a Food Culture and Food Politics class exploring the urgent issues of our time. \n\nThe first note is that there’s longer history that precedes these moments of reckoning of racism and sexism.\n\n“This isn’t just a moment in the wake of terrible things happening, like the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, the Atlanta shootings, the daily barrage of violence against people of color, women, and trans people,” Tongson explains. \n\n“But the social inequities laid bare by the pandemic have really shone an unrelenting light on these problems and demanded accountability from those of us who have invested in the places where we’re trying to do good work, but coming up against the prejudices baked into these institutions.” \n\n“I’m hoping that we can be the change and that our workplaces live up to the challenge of transforming the culture of not only where we work but the world we live in.” \n\n🎧 More of KT's conversations with @mignardisela @estarla @lientigre @soo_nfood @dorinne.kondo in this special episode on @kcrw or wherever you get your podcasts. #AAPIGoodFood\n📷: @jenrosenstein / Courtesy of Karen Tongson",
  "It’s #SpringBreak and we realized we need to honor the moment when we come out of the darkness of winter and move toward the light. It’s a time of rebirth, renewal, and a lot of delicious food. \n\nWith Easter around the corner, we revisited all the things that eggs can do. In 2017, @kcrwevan spoke with food writer and novelist @rrrrrrrachelkhong who edited the collection of essays, stories and recipes called ALL ABOUT EGGS.\n\nAlong with tips like how to determine if an egg is fresh without cracking it open, she shared book highlights from what nuns have to do with egg custard tarts to unsolved murder mysteries that start and end with a plate of poached eggs.\n\n“I think what’s so amazing about eggs is that they’re so sensitive to temperature,” Khong says. “It’s really a matter of seconds when you’re cooking eggs, and I think that’s why they make for such interesting ingredients even for chefs at the highest echelon.”\n\n“Eggs and ketchup is one of the classic combos of all time,” she declares. “Egg and tomato is also really good—a scrambled egg with tomato—which is something I grew up with as a Chinese child.” \n\nBut the book also engages in the age-old question. “I really wanted to have a component in the book that was about backyard chickens. We touched on factory farm chickens and all the different labels that go along with eggs, and the complicated nature of buying eggs today. But I wanted to touch on the phenomenon of raising chickens in your backyard. It reminded me of a pet chicken that I had when I was little, Moesha the Chicken, named after my favorite TV show at the time.” \n\n🎧 More of this conversation on our latest episode on @kcrw or wherever you get your podcasts.\n📷: Courtesy of Pixabay / Canva",
  "It is no secret that Asian restaurants have had an especially difficult year because of COVID. First, when the disease started to spread, some people stopped going to Asian restaurants because of unfounded fears. That same racist thinking also drove a spike in hate incidents against Asian Americans since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nLast week, @kcrwevan was on @kcrwpressplay with @themadbrand and said that Asian women are really the spine of LA’s restaurant scene. \n\n“When I look around at the community of restauranteurs that are really engaged and that we’ve covered over the years—the twentysomething years I’ve been doing Good Food—there are so many Asian women in the business who are owners, or they’re GMs, operations people, or they’re writers or community organizers,” Evan says. \n\n“You cannot look at the vibrancy and the creativity and the flowering of what’s been going on in the LA restaurant scene over the past decade and not notice that Asian women have an outsize importance in all of this.”\n\n“All food people are barely hanging on at this point. And then this overlay of hate that’s aimed at them and has taken on this bald, violent expression is just another layer of emotional burden that everyone in this community has to take on. It’s a wonder that they are still forging ahead and creating new things even as we speak.”\n\n“I just think kindness right now is what most of us can do. We can go and at least patronize businesses to help their bottom line. And when you’re there: interact with people, be kind, tell them that you’re thinking about them, you care, and you’re appalled.” \n\nTag the #AAPIGoodFood ladies you know shaping the food + restaurant industry in Los Angeles and beyond.

  "Tacos are life in LA and every great taco starts with a great tortilla. As Good Food’s annual Tortilla Contest has taught us, you don’t have to rely on bad supermarket tortillas to get you through your next homemade breakfast burrito or taco. Great tortillas are made across Southern California, but LA PRINCESITA is a special case. Monica Ramirez and Enrique Rodriguez told us about their family empire built on masa.\n\n“My father Francisco Ramirez started the Princesita tortilleria in the early 1970s shortly after he immigrated to the U.S. from Cuernavaca, Mexico,” Monica explains. “My parents would take me to the stores or the tortilleria every day. Instead of going out and playing with kids to the park or the playground, I would go to work with my parents and I loved it. Never did I try to get away from the family business.”\n\n“I really attribute our existence today to Francisco, or “Pancho,” as he was known,” Enrique says. “He had the vision to immigrate to the United States looking for a better life for his family starting off just selling tortillas out of a storefront. And then growing that, he started developing the carniceria and the grocery aspect. It was really because of creating this foundation of a multifaceted and diverse business that we’re still around today.”\n\n“The last year for us has presented a number of challenges and has really been quite a rollercoaster. We predominantly serve the restaurant industry and distribution companies that serve the restaurant industry so as restaurants started to close across the region, we did see a significant decrease in our tortilla sales.” \n\n“I’d say that the biggest challenge for us was keeping our people and our customers safe. We were scrambling to make sure that we had enough product not only to sell to our communities, but that our employees had what they needed to survive. We wanted to make sure that they also had eggs, milk, toilet paper. To make sure the ones who were coming in and serving the community were taken care of themselves and their families.”\n\n🎧 More #GoodFoodInTheWeeds in our latest episode on @kcrw\n📷: Courtesy of @laprincesitatortilleria",
  "As the pandemic took hold of the nation, one community in particular began to crack early—NYC’s Chinatown—faced with economic concerns and xenophobic fears. Author and culinary historian Grace Young co-created CORONAVIRUS CHINATOWN STORIES which shares the narratives of small business owners struggling to stay open in the wake of the pandemic. \n\n“The day that we were in Chinatown was really the last day that Chinatown was as we think of it,” Young shares. “We were recording living history documenting where everybody was at that moment.”\n\nOne of the interviews was with Mei Chau who owned a Mayalsian-French restaurant called Aux Epices which closed its doors last year:\n\n“We did a very good delivery but we still had to shut it down because our workers are afraid [for] their safety,” Chau began. “They have to take the subway when they finish work around 10 or 11. The fear—their families are really worried about their safety. You go to work and you might not come back.“ \n\n“Maybe we think this is hysterical, but it’s real for us in the Chinese community. They’re afraid [for] their safety, they’re afraid of this virus, that this virus will infect their community. Then it’s really the stigma in saying, ‘Look, the Chinese have all the virus.’”\n\nYoung adds, “I was in Chinatown recently when I saw somebody go up to a street vendor and just knock down their umbrella and cart. My husband ran after the guy but people are subjected to a lot of abuse right now. I’m very scared and I am really scrambling to do anything I can to keep the arteries and the blood and the oxygen flowing through Chinatown.

  "Spoon By H is the food world’s equivalent of a Cinderella story. Chef Yoonjin Hwang opened shop in 2012 and served a loyal customer base until Chef @davidchang shared a photo of her manduguk to his more than 1 million Instagram followers, catapulting this small restaurant to international fame. But the pandemic did not spare @spoonbyh, which a few weeks ago made the difficult decision to close. \n\n“COVID hit us hard in so many ways. We lost business but had to take extra costs to meet safety requirements. We had to let go of all our staff and scale down our operations. And we started to see a big increase in customers disputing charges or requesting refunds through delivery apps.”\n\n“There were fraudulent claims that they hadn’t received their orders when they had. As a default, they are almost always granted the refunds. A few months back, a customer placed one of the largest orders we’ve ever had. I helped him shuttle all of the food into his van. He later disputed the charge and we lost over $700 even with photo evidence of the order.”\n\n“When taking orders from customers, I found myself feeling weary and suspicious of everyone. I felt myself changing and realized that this is not the way I wanted to run a business, and that I needed to step away before it really started to affect my health mentally and physically.”\n\n“When we made an announcement that we would be closing, one of our dearest and oldest customers immediately started a GoFundMe page and the response was overwhelming. I don’t think I can really explain what it means to me to have been so hurt and disappointed by the worst in people but then at the same time receive an unbelievable amount of comfort and love from the very best in people. I’m grateful for the reminder that there is more good in the world than there is bad.” \n\n“I need to take time to grieve a little bit. I’m not quite ready yet to immediately dive into planning my next steps but when I have had a chance to recharge and get back on my feet, I hope there will be an opportunity to repay you all for the grace you have shown us.

  "Golden Rice Co., a pop-up run by the mother and daughter team of Farah and Sophia Parsa, was originally a backyard supper club. When the pandemic prevented gatherings, they put the menu on Instagram and started accepting orders. Now, they’re doing more cooking than they ever imagined.\n\n“Tahchin is a very traditional Persian food that typically is made in the oven,” Sophia explains. “It’s infused with saffron, has oil, yogurt, eggs, and it almost mimics a rice cake. The top layer is really crispy and we put that tahdig top over the Tahchin dish. You’re getting that thing that people call the gold of the rice.”\n\n“Growing up, my mom had always been cooking and keeping our doors open for anyone who wanted to join us for dinner. At some point, I started hosting supper club dinners in my backyard. We were hosting 100 people and at the first meeting, my mom noticed we were short on food. Like any Middle Eastern mother, she jumped on the opportunity to cook for us.”\n\n“Just a few months before that, I lost my father who she was typically cooking for and I noticed that she had lost a sense of purpose. The minute she had an opportunity to cook for people again, it brightened her in a way that I hadn’t seen her in many months. From there, we started hosting these monthly dinners centered around her cooking and the food I was raised on.”\n\n“When the pandemic hit, we put our menu onto Instagram and started accepting orders. One week after the next, it started to grow.”\n\n“With any family business, there’s challenges. We come from very different backgrounds, very different generations.

  "As the brutal havoc the pandemic has waged on the restaurant industry continues, we look for a silver lining. It’s the reckoning that happens when circumstances seem as though they can’t get any worse and the opportunity to change what wasn’t working in the first place is finally embraced. \n\nProfessor Alex Susskind of the Cornell School of Hotel Administration says this is the most disruptive period he has seen in the restaurant industry. He suggests that restaurants are now figuring out what the airline and hotel industry has been doing for years—having their clientele pay before service, giving them the ability to charge more as product price and availability change.\n\n“The restaurant business involves pretty grueling work,” Susskind says. “It’s a demanding business. Wages in the restaurant industry have been historically low.”\n\nThe average restaurant spends up to 65 percent of every dollar on food, beverage, and labor, leaving small margins for other expenses, including rent.\n\n“Restaurants have always had a hard time [figuring] out ways to increase their prices when they have to because of the way the transaction takes place,” he continues. “In most sit-down restaurants, you don’t pay until you’re done consuming the meal, so that’s a really complicated relationship you have with your guest.”\n\n“In an airline or a hotel, you pay for that product before you consume it. When fuel costs go up, airlines don’t think twice about raising the price on the ticket, or adding a surcharge to make up the costs. The majority of the money that you give them, you pay for for in advance.” \n\n“Restaurants are very, very different. So now restaurants have an opportunity to build in some additional support for their business that they oftentimes have to eat. We’re seeing with takeout and delivery, you’re paying for these products now ahead of time where you wouldn’t typically do that.” \n\n“I know plenty of operations who wanted nothing to do with Grubhub or Uber Eats or DoorDash or any of these companies like, ‘That’s not me.’ But they’re all in now because they don’t have a choice.”\n\n🎧 More in our latest episode on @kcrw\n📷: Courtesy of Pixabay / CC BY 2.0",
  "Black excellence has long been celebrated in popular culture. Think sports, music, literature, and film. But why the delay in the culinary industry to recognize the contributions of Black cooks and innovators? Marcus Samuelsson shines the spotlight on the achievements and influence of those behind Black food in America. His book, THE RISE, describes the complexity and diversity of Black food and the cooks who make it.\n\n“THE RISE was really an opportunity to appreciate and bring back the authorship of Black food, really unpack it in a way because it’s told so wrong if you even can find it,” Samuelsson says. \n\n“I thought it was important to talk about authorship, to talk about memory, and also aspiration. If there’s no worth, if the value proposition of who makes the stuff, where the stuff comes from, is off, you don’t know anything of its memories, and you can’t create aspiration.”\n\n“If you talk about, ‘Hey I want to give you a box of Belgian chocolate,’ there’s no cocoa beans in Belgium. They’re all in Ghana. So every time we rephrase that to Belgium, that level of excellence, we write out of the history the process of making chocolate and cocoa in Africa. “\n\n“We’ve done it with coffee forever.  We’ve said, ‘Oh I want that French roast coffee’ or, ‘That Italian coffee is amazing’ but the coffee beans we know come from Ethiopia and Kenya. And we don’t do that with any European product.”\n\n“It’s important to name the place where the food comes from. That then connects a level of excellence and aspiration.”\n\n“Nearest Green created the recipe for Jack Daniel’s. He didn’t make a dime. Imagine if [he] would have been compensated for doing that. How many other Black people would have gone into bourbon making? What that would have done for both wealth and also for the worth of bourbon in the culture, how many jobs they would have created. It is meaningful to have the authorship—the ownership—back. The starting post has to be corrected.”\n\n🎧 More in our latest episode of Good Food on @kcrw \n📷: @voraciousbooks / @angiemosier",

They’ve always struggled and we’ve always fed the neighborhood, we’ve always participated in keeping an eye out. And certainly, people have always kept an eye out for us.”\n\n“One of the things that we’ve done to support ourselves is started feeding the John Wesley Healthcare Center down on Skid Row. We looked at what they needed and thought, how do we parlay this into some sort of subsidy for ourselves that keeps our restaurant together, keeps my employees together, and helps all these folks? You go down to Skid Row, and there’s just so many people in need.”\n\n“One of the great things that the Nickel has provided us are the connections that we have to our customers and our community. That’s what’s great about food. It’s the ultimate unifier and allows you to see the humanity around you and connect with people that you would never think you had something in common with.”\n\n🎧 More #GoodFoodInTheWeeds in our latest episode\n📷: Courtesy of Nickel Diner",
  "During the 17th and 18th centuries, “tea was what a limited-edition sneaker drop or what Perigord black truffles are today,” writes Charlene Wang in her piece for @whetstonemagazine tracing tea back to colonialism and its lingering problems of racial, class, gender, and labor hierarchies. \n\n“In the beginning, China was interested in silver,” Chen explains. “And the British East India Company, and I think the Dutch East India Company to a degree, were able to trade tea for silver. It was a trade that was interchanged of sugar, enslaved people, cotton, silver, and opium. These were all commodities that were being circulated to facilitate the export of tea from Asia to Europe.”\n\n“It’s a very specific history of colonial trade and exploitation that still has vestiges today. These plantations are still set up on colonial labor structures. Just how people are remunerated, what is expected, how labor is recruited—all of it, it doesn’t look that different than the 19th Century today.”\n\n“I think it’s important to think about the tea as a plant and not just as a flattened commodity. Tea was traded as a commodity to suit colonial markets but, in fact, tea is a living plant. Well-crafted artisinal tea requires an incredible amount of labor, from the farmers to the growers and the people who are picking the tea. It’s a lot of expertise, literal hands-on labor. When you think about that as you’re looking at tea and how to buy it, maybe that will make prices in context feel different.” \n\nAnd in the isolation of the current moment, maybe we can learn from the ritual of stillness that making tea can offer. \n\n“I’ve had so many conversations with people about how starved they are for ritual or this idea of ceremony and ritual that everyone feels bereft of, and they’re turning to tea as sort of a spiritual pathway.” \n\n“When tea first went to Japan, the monk that’s credited for bringing it to Japan went to China to study a form of esoteric Buddhism. And he learned about tea because the monks there were using tea to stay up to meditate. It was used as a way to keep monks awake for spiritual enlightenment.”\n\n🎧 More in our latest episode of Good Food \n📷: Courtesy of Charlene Wang",
  "In downtown LA, just a stone’s throw away from the formerly bustling Santee Alley, is the tiny light-filled Brazilian restaurant @woodspoon. Chef Natalia Pereira describes the sense of home she provides at her restaurant, a passion project to bring the diasporic food of her hometown to Los Angeles.\n\n“I opened Wood Spoon in 2006 and my main focus was to represent and recreate a feeling of home,” Pereira shares. “I’m from Minas [Gerais], a well known state in Brazil.”\n\n“I feel that a kitchen is an incredible classroom. I didn’t have a formal education. I have learned other countries and other culinary trades and places to educate myself. I couldn’t speak a word of English but I didn’t have to talk to the tomato or to the carrot or to the fresh garlic. It was more a relationship.” \n\n“I have a lot of respect for food because at points in my life, I didn’t have it. Food has been, for me, a best friend, a companion, a form of education, a feeling of home. And that’s why I built Wood Spoon, so that I can share my home with perfect strangers. And a lot of these strangers have now become family to me and have been part of my dream.”\n\n“Now that we are all under COVID, my tables remain set [but] the seats are empty. And that has been also sad for many of our wonderful patrons and guests. When they are at the restaurant, they feel like they are at home, or somebody loves them, made that meal for them. And that is something that I cherish very much so.”\n\n“Food is still the bridge that connects us all. I will stand strong as much as I can through the difficulties that we are facing. I would like to continue to feed my community. Cooking is my passion. It’s a very intimate thing to prepare a meal for someone. It takes me home.”\n\n“We need to have a reminder that we are still here. There’s so much in the food world that’s one’s life, that’s one’s story. And I think it’s worth it to be preserved and shared. People should come out and share what they know in times when we all need some kind of a connection to one another to remind us of who we are.”\n\n🎧 More in our latest episode of #GoodFoodInTheWeeds 📷: Courtesy of Wood Spoon",
  "Lydia Clarke and her family have been hand-selling cheese with one customer at a time for years at @dtlacheese in @grandcentralmarketla.\n\n“I feel so honored to be a cheesemonger,” Clarke says while holding back tears. “When pandemic hit, it felt overwhelming. The market stayed open but we decided to take a couple of days to just pause and create an online store.”\n\n“In Grand Central Market it would be elbow-to-elbow, shoulder-to-shoulder, so many people. It went from being a hustling, bustling marketplace to crickets almost overnight. So our day-to-day walk-up counter business just dramatically changed.”\n\n“I think a cheese shop is a destination. It’s somebody that is choosing to go out of their way for a specialty product made by incredible people. It’s usually somebody who walks by and really the cheese will choose you. You can’t resist it.”\n\n“With outdoor dining being outside, people were able then to still come to the market, eat something, then take home a piece of cheese. When that was pulled too, it was another screech and halt because we were just kind of avoided altogether.”\n\n“People really have had to go out of their way to visit us in the market. It’s not anything that any of us obviously wanted or wished upon our businesses but just to see the beauty of our community, of how many people have continued to make it part of their weekly food budgets, coming in to a tiny little shop and supporting a microbusiness that really loves what we do.”\n\n“Our whole business model has been flipped on its head of [tasting] it together to know what you’re taking home. Now with masks, we’re not even tasting cheese so it’s more of a trust conversation. Sometimes people just don’t care, they just want good cheese and that’s also really great too.”\n\n“I wake up and I’m still honored to do what I do. I love having a tiny cheese shop. I love that I have it with my sister and my partner. I think I do it for my family. I love them and I know that they’re so proud of me and I’m proud of them. And it’s a legacy that my sister and I get to do and make our grandfather and father really proud of us.”\n\n🎧 More in our latest episode of #GoodFoodInTheWeeds 📷: Courtesy of @dtlacheese",
  "Chef Glen Ishii won’t reveal the secret formula for chashu marinade his grandmother started that’s served at @jistcafe. His grandmother was known for her chashu shumai combination that she served on Fridays. Over 70 years later, Ishii serves his version of chashu hash with sous vide eggs and potatoes for breakfast.\n\n“My grandmother started the restaurant before WWII,” Ishii shares. “I was born in the 70s and my father and my mother were doing the restaurant and I was growing up as a kid just being trouble in Little Tokyo.”\n\n“My father passed away in the year 2000 so we closed the restaurant [that year]. A couple years later, my uncle opened up the restaurant Tokyo Cafe where our existing location is right now. I wanted to do something on my own so Caroline Shin and I partnered up and opened up JiST Cafe.”\n\n“My grandmother was known for this one dish called the combination which was a chashu shumai. It’s a Chinese dish which is a bbq pork and the Japanese just put their own twist on it. I took the chashu dish from my family and I put it into a hash. I made it into a more Asian dish because I’m Asian American.”\n\n“What’s great about Little Tokyo the community itself, our landlord is @ltsc.cdc which a nonprofit organization. When the pandemic first started, they set up a program asking restaurants in the area to come up with menus and cook for the seniors. They came to the restaurant, picked it up, and delivered it to the senior living homes that are in Little Tokyo.”\n\n“Outdoor dining was very difficult to say yes or no because we’re running such a small crew right now and if one of us were to get sick, we would actually have to shut down the restaurant for a few weeks. I don’t even know if I have the right answers, or the wrong answers, or if what I’m doing is correct or not correct. All I’m trying to do is taking care of each customer, one by one.”\n\n“We do have a lot of regulars and especially when I brought back my grandmother’s dish. The seniors in Little Tokyo were customers of my parents and of my grandmother. They remember good times so the only thing I could do for people is try to cook the best food I can cook. Cook for customers to bring them happiness.”",
  "When the hospitality industry shut down this spring, the Boyle Heights-based initiative @nouswithoutyou vowed to assist undocumented restaurant workers. A “no questions asked” service, they are serving 1400 families a week with groceries, free tutoring to students, job placement, reliable transportation, and this week, Christmas toys. Othón Nolasco founded the program with his business partner, Damian Diaz.\n\n“Nine months ago, the industry shut down in Los Angeles and [we] saw a lot of GoFundMe and other crowdfunding jumping up and noticed that everyone was focused on the front of the house—the bartenders, the servers—and as former operators of bars and restaurants, we knew that the back of the house was going to be in a lot of trouble because they weren’t going to be eligible for any unemployment insurance or federal assistance,” Nolasco shares. \n\n“We’re very aware that food insecurity was a problem before we started to help, but in the past 9 months, we’ve seen it in our neighborhood that our neighbors that are undocumented that are citizens of the United States that are hungry, that need food. We plan on growing as much as we can. We are trying our hardest to fundraise continuously and to apply for grants. Unfortunately, some of those grants we don’t qualify for because we haven’t been in business for a full year. But we’re not quitting, we’re going to help as many people be food secure as we possibly can.”\n\nBesides food security, it quickly evolved to fill the needs of families, from tutoring for kids who are home to a job placement program. \n\n“Every child this week for Christmas will get new toys, which is huge. These kids are used to going to the grocery store and asking their parents for their favorite food or snack or toy and that doesn’t happen right now. We’re able to provide learning toys, board games, and educational materials. We’re going to try to give these kids the best Christmas that 2020 can provide.”\n\n📷: @melhummel @mathieuyoung courtesy of @nouswithoutyou",
  "Chef and owner Daniel Navarro’s grandmother, Gladys, opened EL COCHINITO in 1988 in a small strip mall along Sunset Boulevard in Silver Lake. Much has changed in the three decades since, but Daniel is still serving the food he grew up with, including an award-winning Cuban sandwich. \n\n“El Cochinito is certainly a neighborhood restaurant in a neighborhood that has changed a lot,” Navarro says. “We think of the kitchen and the food as sort of a time capsule. We really try to preserve the cuisine of our family in Cuba and our culture.” \n\n“I can’t tell you exactly how it was before I was born, but I do know Silver Lake and Echo Park were a pretty popular place for Cuban Americans to settle. There were plenty of restaurants, lots of small business owners around the neighborhood, and El Cochinito was one of the centers for that.” \n\n“I can remember when I was a kid just all the older Cubans hanging around lunchtime smoking their cigars outside. We see those people and their families and their kids and their grandkids still coming through the restaurant so I feel like it still holds that connection.”\n\n“I was fascinated with everything about the restaurant. I used to love waking up early with my grandmother and going to the markets downtown, picking up the produce, getting the beans on the stove. It was always very much a part of my life as a child.”\n\n“But it wasn’t until I was a little bit older and really started to understand the restaurant and the impact on our family and on our community that I was really concrete with the decision that keeping this restaurant in our family was going to be definitely a part of my life.”\n\n“COVID has changed our business in a lot of ways. Obviously we’ve lost our dining room and that opportunity to make those little connections and host birthday parties and anniversaries and things like that.” \n\n“A little bit of time fell on our lap when things slowed down and kind of forced us to really challenge ourselves and look at what we’re doing. We found ways to grow and connect with our community. It’s been an interesting opportunity within all the struggles and all the sleepness nights.” \n\n#GoodFoodInTheWeeds\n📷: Courtesy of @cochinitola",
  "FOUND OYSTER is a seafood shack located on a quiet block in East Hollywood that @latimesfood critic @bill_addison described as “at once like a refuge and a party.” Times have changed but the team is still shucking. \n\n“Found Oyster was built to be a place for everybody to come and enjoy an easy cup of chowder, an amazing piece of broiled fish, have a Coors Banquet beer or a really elegant glass of champagne,” says chef and co-owner Ari Kolender.\n\n“On any given night before the pandemic, Found Oyster was abuzz. Loud disco music playing, and a lot of cheery nature all throughout. COVID brought our business to a halt. We did not have a good takeout option right away so we decided to completely press the brakes.”\n\n“Unfortunately, we are such a tiny restaurant, we don’t have any patio space or parking lot behind the restuarant. It’s just a narrow sidewalk so outdoor dining was not even in the cards.”\n\n“Back in July, we finally petitioned the city to create a parklet out of two parking spaces in front, which, originally we had been approved for, and then we found out they ran out of funding.”\n\n“We built a deck, built a trellis system, put some plants out, string lights—proper COVID patio. The patio cost us around $11,000. We were able to get that set up about a week and a half before the county decided to shut outside dining again.”\n\n“The original idea behind the seafood market was to provide the neighborhood with all kinds of seafood. We go through pretty big lengths to get seafood from all over the country. We started taking requests from people and have expanded the list of products and fish.”\n\n“If there’s one thing that I’ve learned in this pandemic, it’s that you have to be ready to pivot at every second. You cannot wait and pray that one thing is going to work better than another or that something or someone is going to bail you out.” \n\n“My staff and myself find strength in the fact that this is what we do, this is who we are, and this is where we’ll be moving forward. The pandemic is obviously nowhere near over, but at the same time, there’s nothing else any of us would rather do.” \n\n#GoodFoodInTheWeeds 📷: Courtesy of @foundoyster",
  "Food can center and heal if we’re open to enlarging our frame of reference. Healing is at the center of a new film GATHER, a must-see for anyone who lives and eats in America. Director @mrsanjayr talked with us about how the recovery of ancient foodways marks a path forward for Native Americans to bring back health and vitality to their people.\n\n“I’d always wanted to explore the ideals of Indigenous agriculturalists past the labor aspect and look at the initial theft of land that drove the American economy,” Rawal explains. “And that theft of land really was directly related to the destruction of the Native American food system.”\n\nThis dates back to post-Civil War when the depleted US military launched assymetrical attacks to gain control and expand onto Native land. “They began slaughtering buffalo indiscriminately, burning fields, destroying the Native American food system by force in order to yoke them to American Army ration.”\n\n“What’s now the US was by no means wilderness. It was a carefully cultivated ecosystem with Native scientists, Native animal husbandry experts, Native hunters, Native farmers that had been working in harmony with Mother Earth for tens of thousands of years. Indian Country’s land was taken away but their culture was destroyed too, systemically, trying to separate them from their traditions in order to assimilate them, in order to get access to their resources.” \n\n“Now in the 21st century, most of Indian Country has been separated by force from the same types of food traditions that gave them the strength that they had pre-contact. At the same time, they’re at the end of supply chains, they don’t have economic opportunity, and it’s much easier to buy junk food than it is to buy healthy food. So to save themselves physically and to restore their cultural and spiritual pride, they’ve turned to rediscovering those old foodways and making them the norm.” \n\n“They feel like the Industrial Revolution is over, the extractive capitlaism that drove economies has to end, and people have to develop a relationship with Earth that’s more unconditional and that’s less extractve. And that needs to start with the food system first and foremost.”",
  "What is the essential dish on your Thanksgiving table? No two answers are ever the same, as told by our special co-host @davidchang who cites both his mom’s galbi jjim and the American staple of stuffing. \n\nOn our Thanksgiving show, we talk savory pies, small bird alternatives, leftovers for pho with @andreanguyen88, and Dave’s hot take on turkey in a scaled-down year of celebrations. \n\n“I don’t love turkey in general,” Chang starts. “The turkey was something we embraced simply because it was such an iconic American thing. I feel a lot of immigrants probably feel the same way about turkey. People love the idea of turkey more than anything else.”\n\n“I’m not anti-turkey. I’m just sort of taking pause here. I’m not trying to tell anyone not to cook a turkey. I’m going to cook turkey again this year for my family. I’m just sort of asking myself when are we going to change it to doing something else? I want to have the courage one year not to cook turkey.”\n\nBut above all else in 2020, no matter your meal?\n\n“Keep it simple. I think that’s the most important thing. It’s been a crazy year, and it’s a good time to reflect about the things that we have, not the things that we don’t have. After this year, that’s what we should be focusing on. Not the recipes, not the food, or even the turkey.” \n \n📷: Courtesy of MIRAME, Andrew Bezek, John Carey & Gillian Ferguson",
  "What would you give up for your family? For Justin Pichetrungsi, chef/owner of @anajakthaifood, the answer was his career. Justin grew up playing hide-and-seek among the tables at his family’s 39-year-old restaurant in Sherman Oaks. \n\n“We’ve been in the same location as a neighborhood spot for 39 years,” Pichetrungsi says. “Most of our customers are regulars. And I grew up here. I grew up in the back, I grew up in the kitchen, I grew up in the front of the house watching my father work behind the wok, seeing my seeing my parents work together.”\n\n“Before I worked at Anajak full-time, I was working as a concept artist and an art director at the Walt Disney Company. When you’re working a big corporate job, you have these dreams and you just never know how those things are gonna happen.”\n\n“After my father’s stroke, my mother said, ‘I know you don’t want to think of it this way, but the univese is giving you an opening to do what you’ve always wanted to do.’”\n\nOpening the “tiny little spot” was, after all, a dream for his father four decades ago. “I think my responsibility is to be the steward of Anajak,” Justin says. “It’s an honor and a pleasure for me to take care of it, to take care of the people, to take care of the rickety, rusted building with the doors that kind of work and the burners that only work like this when you turn the knobs like this.” \n\n“My job has been to maintain it. And I think that in the future my job will hopefully be to grow it and see it continue on. Hopefully at least another 40 years. I know that’s insane, but I look up to all these winemakers and they’re like multi, multi, multigenerational.

  "Lupe and Judy Liang opened Hop Woo BBQ & Seafood in Chinatown 26 years ago with eight tables and an American Dream. Like many immigrant families, owning a restaurant was a way to provide so that their kids wouldn’t have to spend time behind a hot stove. \n\nTheir daughters went on to get degrees in Business Administration and Graphic Design but when the pandemic hit, Mary and Kelley found themselves having to support their parents in new and unexpected ways. \n\n“Both of my parents don’t speak very much English so during COVID, any time that they needed more information about the regulations or what was going on, they would have to come to us,” Mary shares.\n\n“Sometimes they would hear different information from their friends so they would question our information. We’re still their kids and they don’t quite trust us, but at the same time they also have to depend on us for a lot of things. Even applying for the grants and the loans, I had to do all of that for them.”\n\n“It’s been really hard because they’ve been putting their blood, sweat, and tears into this. It’s pretty much their other baby. And it’s really difficult to watch something they’ve put so much work into get to the point where we don’t know if we’ll be able to stay open or not.”\n\nAs restauranteurs know, what’s at risk is about more than just the business. \n\n“My parents decided to take a loan out on the house to help pay for the restaurant so losing the restaurant pretty much means losing the house as well. We’ve asked the landlord to reduce our rent maybe about three times so far since the pandemic but they’re unwilling to negotiate with us. The best that they’ve been able to offer us is to defer half of the rent until 2021.”\n\n“My dad always tries to keep the prices affordable. He always says some of the older community can’t really go anywhere to get food and also can’t really afford it, so we try to make it so anybody can come in and eat.”\n\nIf you do? “You definitely have to get the spicy salt chicken wings,” Kelley says. “I would definitely get the Peking duck which comes with bread and sauce and some veggies. Also our lobster with noodles.”\n\n#GoodFoodInTheWeeds\n📷: Courtesy of Mary Liang",
  "Hearing the stories of restauranteurs, chefs, and other food workers reminds us amidst everything that small independent businesses are still fighting for their survival and we the eaters have the power to help them. \n\nIn the early days of the pandemic, there was much hand-wringing about the end of the buffet. Pre-pandemic, @mayurarestaurant in Culver City was known for their South Indian lunch buffet. We asked owner Dr. Padmini Ayani to tell us what life in the restaurant has been like these past six months.\n\n“Myself and my family moved to the United States in 2003 as immigrants with two teenagers and my sister and brother-in-law,” Dr. Padmini shares. “As new immigrants, we didn’t have enough finance to start a business, so we started managing a start-up restaurant business to learn the ropes and regulations of the country. My children also worked part-time along with their schooling so we saved all of our money and we started Mayura in 2006.”\n\nLike many restaurants in the past year, Mayura had to adapt when the unthinkable hit.\n\n“This pandemic was considered a thing of the past. We started reading the news and thought this wasn’t going to come to Los Angeles or going to touch us. When the numbers started to climb in California, it was a dramatic change. And overnight, our business dropped. I still remember the initial days we hardly had one-fourth of the business.”\n\n“We signed up with [food delivery companies], all these apps to get the online business. All our regulars also were supporting us. Some of our families we have seen for years—from dating to getting married and having children. We do their baby showers, we did their babies’ first birthday parties, it was a meeting place for the community.”\n\nBut still, the operational side was tough. \n\n“It’s very hard to furlough Indian employees. When the pandemic started, we told them we are trying to do our level best to keep everybody employed. Everybody utilized the time to cross-train each other and learn the new packing methods. We kept all of them, all of these employees are from day one onwards. They have nowhere else to go.”\n\n#GoodFoodInTheWeeds 📷: @mayurarestaurant",
  "In our new weekly segment #GoodFoodInTheWeeds, we attempt to cover the vastness of what is happening in restaurants by collecting individual stories that in their sum weave together a narrative of an industry at a crossroads in a pandemic.\n\nThis week, @roxanajullapat of Friends and Family, a bakery and cafe in East Hollywood, describes the act of putting one foot in front of the other in a pandemic.\n\n“To be a bakery owner during the current time is an introspective exercise,” Jullapat shares. “You have to wake up in the morning with a short term goal of just getting to the bakery and putting that bread in the oven and sort of ignore the larger pressures of, ‘Are we gonna make payroll? Are we gonna make it through the end of the month? Are we gonna be open at the end of the year?’ You may not be able to make a projection for your income for the month of December but you are able to make sure that your next batch of spelt blueberry muffins comes out perfect.” \n\n“One thing we talk about often is mental health. We all feel the strain. Now it’s definitely a vital part of our operation: being aware that people are very very very on the verge of panicking. How are we going to react when that happens, and how do we prevent those moments of feeling like there is no hope?”\n\nBut those days will come in a pandemic, no matter how much you prepare.\n\n“I want to quit about every day that I’m open since March. And then I take it all back by the end of the day. There is certainly an amount of joy that is not present anymore in running the business and yet I definitely can say I have small wins every single day. I feel really strong at the moment but I definitely cut myself some slack and know there will be times in which I’ll be probably ready to give up. And that’s okay.”\n\nStill, you have to hold joy. \n\n“It has been a really heartening and almost funny experience to see Los Angeles [have] a newfound appreciation for bread. I have taken a lot of joy in making that bread and knowing that people are looking at it under a whole new light. If you come to Friends and Family, that’s what I want you to try. A really good and delicious chunk of our bread.”\n\n📷: @wearefriendsandfamily",

  "2018 was the year of the #basquecheesecake. Food writer Daniela Galarza of the @washingtonpost became obsessed with the “ugly-beautiful” dessert and chased down versions starting with La Viña’s in San Sebastian, Spain to document the history and chef quest for their own recipe in her piece for @taste.\n\n“I think usually when people think of cheesecake, they’re thinking of this pristine white top and very velvety interior that’s all one texture, a really neat and tidy crust,” Galarza explains. “But a Basque cheesecake is burnt on the top and it’s not all one texture on the inside but that’s also what makes it so good.”\n\n“When I was in Santiago, Spain—and I was only there for four days—I ran into three chefs from New York and LA. In the time before the pandemic, when travel was really open, you’d go to these places and see what the local community was dreaming up. I think a lot of restaurant groups used to do [this] on a regular basis in search of inspiration. And they went to the Basque Country and the cheesecake was just one element that they picked up on. I think a lot of chefs pass through that city and were inspired by it.”\n\nBut how did the dessert move beyond chef circles into a shared viral food obsession? \n\n“When it’s something that’s easy enough that you can make at home, then you’ve got the two-pronged expansion. You’ve got people like me who are just curious about food and write about food that help expand it in that way. But you’ve also got home cooks who are excited about trying different recipes. I think it’s been online for about a decade so it’s sort of been spreading gradually. I like that social media can help spread that and I like that it sort of democratizes that spread a bit.” \n\n🎧More on the latest episode on @kcrw or wherever you get your podcasts. 📷: Wonho Frank Lee",

  "Like most teenagers coming of age, all Marianna Leivaditaki wanted to do was escape her surroundings. Growing up on the Greek island of Crete with a fisherman father and a mother who ran the family restaurant, chores ranged from hanging octopus off the clothesline to gutting fish and setting tables. And while she is head chef of Morito in London, the recipes and ingredients of her youth inform her first cookbook, AEGEAN.\n\n“From as long as I can remember, we had our seafood restaurant—all my childhood was there,” Leivaditaki shares. “Every single evening of my life was spent at the restaurant. It was a seafood restaurant selling my dad’s catch. You couldn’t find fish like that in another restaurant in town. We all worked from a very young age, and just helped the family—peeled potatoes, scaled fish, served tables, cleared tables. It was just a family business, really. We were all there.”\n\nAs for AEGEAN’s recipes like giant beans with celery and pork belly:\n\n“It’s a staple in Greece and usually it’s made without any meat. It’s a vegan dish in reality, and it comes out as delicious as with meat. The meat is a bonus but when you go to villages or a granny’s house for the summer, she’ll bring out a tray of butter beans.

The McArthur is an heirloom variety with a creamy texture and a rich, olive oil flavor.\n\nThese avocados are so delicious because they spend 18 months on the tree. Few farmers are willing to invest in a slow-maturing avocado, but for Nick Brown and his family, the wait is worth it. \"When it gets through that growing period it turns into a really special, delicious avocado,\" Brown says.\n\nThe fruit is larger and sweeter than Hass, and the green skin won't change color when it's ready, so look for softness to indicate ripeness. We can expect to see them at the market for at least another 4-6 weeks. \n\nStay tuned for more weekly #GoodFoodMarketReport tips and support your local farmers’ markets and community supported agriculture where you can. \n\n📷: Nick Brown / @rincontropics",
  "Filmmaker Pablo Cruz and producer Hallie Davison explore the geographic and historical significance of regional food in Netflix’s “Taco Chronicles.”\n\n“Tacos are daily life. They’re everything,” says Davison. “They’re breakfast, they’re lunch, they’re dinner. They’re absolutely part of the moments that are big and also the kind of small quotidian movements of our day.”\n\n“Each taco is a nation in Mexico within Mexico,” Cruz explains. “So somebody who is from Monterrey will argue that their taco is something or another and the only taco that could be eaten for carnitas is from Michoacán. And even in Michoacán, someone will say that each town has its own taco.”\n\n“The tacos are a landscape in itself and define us as who you are and where you’re from. Defending that kind of micro identity that is only yours and that you perhaps only understand with the people from your block.”\n\n“Unfortunately this pandemic is affecting all aspects of life in Mexico, and particularly the livelihoods of these taqueros who work on the streets,” Davison shares. “That being said, there’s a tremendous spirit of resilience that’s always been part of Mexican culture and there’s a lot of solidarity and a lot of people are trying to find ways to support their taqueros.”\n\n“There are also parts of Mexico City where life simply must go on. So taqueros are continuing to do business. This is their livelihood so they’re willing to take the risk that they might fall ill or get sick, but they see that as a better alternative than not being able to provide for their family.” \n\nYou can catch Taco Chronicles on @netflix and hear more of this conversation on @kcrw or wherever you get your podcasts. 📷: Carlos Pérez Osorio",
  "There is a reckoning afoot in Paris. A city encased in amber with a French colonial past and rigid class structure is giving way to the French women breaking through to something new. Travel and food writer Lindsey Tramuta explores the rise of “The New Pariesienne” in her latest book. \n\n“When I speak about The New Paris, it’s not to say that all the things that have made Paris so compelling for generations suddenly becomes insignificant,” Tramuta explains. “But rather that a place that is valued for the sum of its monuments and traditions will eventually grow stale. So Paris couldn’t rest on it’s laurels as it had.” \n\n“In the dining space, that was a lot of stuffy cooking, very old-fashioned, not particularly interested in any of the foreign influences that were inspiring many chefs who were coming to Paris as a sort of grammar school for how to cook properly and learn the best techniques.”\n\nBut that’s changing. “The New Paris is all about the ways in which the city has built upon that excellent foundation and updated what was classic about the food scene and really opened it up to all kinds of foreign influence.”\n\nFed up with the enduring glass ceiling, the women are leading another way. “There are a number of extremely talented female pastry chefs who have done their time in palace hotel kitchens and fine establishments [like] Nina Métayer, who said, ‘Enough.’ You put in your time for a couple of years but ultimately you will never get to the place you want to be if you just stay in that environment. I think a lot of women who have trained as pastry chefs or chefs from the very beginning see the limitations early on and do try to find other ways around it.”\n\n🎧 Hear the rest of this episode on @kcrw or wherever you get your podcasts. 📷: Joann Pai",
  "Dr. Rattan Lal was awarded the prestigious World Food Prize, considered to be agriculture’s equivalent to a Nobel Peace Prize. Over his career, Dr. Lal developed and mainstreamed a soil-centric approach to increasing food production, which simultaneously conserves natural resources and mitigates climate change. His techniques have helped millions of small farmers and improved the food and nutritional security of more than 2 billion people.\n\n“Soil has very strong connections with terrestrial life. There’s no soil without life, and there’s no life without soil,” says Dr. Lal. \n\n“Soil has the divine power to convert death into life. It should never be taken for granted. It’s a very important natural gift without which life as we know it on the planet would not exist. Death and life are two sides of the same coin.”\n\nThose who feel agriculture is to blame for climate change are thinking about things backwards. “We perform an agricultural act every time we eat. How can you blame an act on which we depend so much? I think we have a responsibility to improve it, not blame it. Agriculture, rather than being blamed, has to be made a solution. The question is how to make it work.”\n\nBut like many challenges we currently face, the solutions may lie within us. “Everybody should realize we have a responsibility not to take natural resources, which are finite and fragile and very precious, for granted. We should not undervalue those resources. It’s when we undervalue them that we mistreat them.” \n\n🎧 Hear more of their conversation about the miracle of soil wherever you get your podcasts.\n📷: Ken Chamberlain",
  "“If a white man kills a wild animal and eats it, we call it hunting game. Sometimes the animal is called venison. Other times it is named - deer, elk, moose. If a black man kills a wild animal and eats it, we call it bushmeat poaching. The animals are too numerous to name and so it is merely called flesh, protein, meat.”\n\nThis week on Good Food, we explore the theme of wonder. As she traveled the world to conduct research for her book “Feasting Wild,” Gina Rae La Cerva discovered that everyone from the poet Horace to Henry David Thoreau elevated wild foods and longed for a simpler way of life in response to excessiveness of civilization and the industrialization of food. Today, so-called “wild foods” have become expensive luxuries served in top restaurants.\n\nEvan also speaks with soil scientist Dr. Rattan Lal, who won the World Food Prize and has devoted his life’s work to increasing food production while simultaneously conserving our natural resources, and Artur Cisar-Erlach, a woodland biologist, who has an obsession with trees and the flavor they add to food.

  "As the pace of restaurant closures quickens, cities are finally getting their act together and trying to save them. Across Los Angeles, from Boyle Heights to Westchester, tables and chairs are occupying what was once a restaurant’s coveted asset: parking spaces.\n\nWe were joined this week by Frances Anderton, host of @kcrwdna, to go deep into how neighborhoods got together to reimagine what it means to dine out. \n\n“The city of Santa Monica instituted a local emergency order which gave businesses permission to apply for a permit to put their tables and chairs out on the sidewalk but even in the parking zones,” Anderton shares about the city bending its very specific policies and usual standards.\n\nThe significance? Its impact on building policies. “Parking absolutely dominates decisions. The joy of eating out in all sorts of cities around the world, and here we are in sunny LA eating in air conditioned interiors. That’s because the automobile has driven planning decisions to an extraordinary degree here in LA.”\n\n“For the last 20 or so years, urban activists have been fighting to change this status quo. People who have wanted to see more housing built in LA have been fighting these parking minimums attached to developments that make it so difficult to build affordable housing. Add to that the fight on behalf of street vendors, you have momentum building.”\n\nAs difficult as the pandemic has been and will continue to be on the restaurant community, the act of tossing out the rulebook has created some openings too. \n\n“This is one of the lights of this challenging period we’re in. Tables are popping up on sidewalks and in parking areas in other parts of town. There’s something afoot here. We’re messing with the urban configuration. It’s fascinating.”\n\n🎧 For more of Frances’s conversation with @kcrwevan, tune in to the latest episode wherever you get your podcasts.

  "Last week, Governor @gavinnewsom proposed new legislation to support California communities disproportionately hit by the coronavirus. The $52 million bill would fund testing and tracing. Staff writer for the @latimes Anita Chabria reported on how COVID-19 has hit agricultural communities particularly hard, especially in the San Joaquin Valley.\n\n“The fault lines were always there. Farm workers have a long history of having to fight for rights from shade to clean water in the fields of California and across the country. 93% of the state’s agricultural workers are Latinx. A lot of our jobs that are those essential workers—the delivery drivers, the field workers, even in medical fields, the technicians—are Latinx.”\n\nChabria says the ongoing challenges to keep people safe link back to the early days of the pandemic.\n\n“There are so many hurdles right now for the farm worker population to be tested. We just didn’t move quick enough. Perhaps in March we didn’t really understand what was happening. Maybe in April we were still figuring it out. But then you come to June and we’re still not moving with a sense of urgency.”\n\nWhile the solution is on par with what all communities need to do until there is a vaccine, farm workers face additional hurdles to getting tested. \n\n“Up to 60% of migrant farm workers might not have documentation. You’re dealing with a population that is not only fearful of deportation but of cost. Making people know that even if they are tested, they’ll be taken care of financially, their families will be okay, that there won’t be stigma or long-term loss. That getting tested is available and okay to do. The virus is not going anywhere until there’s a vaccine.”\n\n🎧 For more on this story, check the latest episode of Good Food wherever you get your podcasts. 📷: Lucy Nicholson / Reuters",
  "We all have opinions about the reopening of restaurants, but we wanted to hear directly from the people who have been going back to work, who would be standing in a hot line with a mask on, or taking orders behind a face shield. So we talked to hospitality professionals about going back to work. \n\nHere’s some of what they had to say: \n\n“I try to think to myself, what would be worth me going out for a cooking job. Like how much would I have to be paid to put my life at risk?”\n\n“I was very excited to come back. I’ve working in restaurants for over 10 years. This is what I do. But once case numbers started to rise again, my mind and my gut were really telling me this isn’t something we should be doing right now, if only to not contribute to the culture of pretending like this virus is gone.” \n\n“We see servers covered head-to-toe in PPE. As a patron, you don’t feel right. You know? What am I putting them under this for, that they’re having to wear PPE while I’m enjoying a jolly cocktail?”\n\n“The customer is always right, I know we always have heard that. But to be honest with you, the customer is very often wrong. At the end of the day, all we’re asking is put a mask on. Just put a mask on. You lose faith in humanity after looking at all these people coming in there just having no regard for what’s going on in the world.”\n\n“I think what’s been really telling in our industry is that even for me, as a manager, my unemployment checks were more than what I make at the restaurant. I think we really need to take that into account and figure out why restaurants were so unsustainable in the fist place. Which they were. This just basically forced a reckoning to happen.”\n\n“My optimism for the hospitality industry is going to be based on if restaurants are willing to make changes for both employees and for guests, and they’re willing to make those changes actively. But because we’re based off of attendance of guests, it’s really the guests that need to make the most changes. It’s going to be a really long time until we’re going to be back to where we were.”\n\n🎧 For more of these first hand accounts, check the rest of the latest episode on the @kcrw app. 📷: @garyhe",
  "Founded by Chef Roy Choi and Kim Gaston, @wearechewbox is a food delivery service focused on healthy, chef-driven meals and job opportunities in underserved communities. Meals are made and delivered from Choi’s former Locol kitchen in Watts, and the program is now open to the public during the pandemic.\n\n\"We had this incredible neighborhood and family of Watts that I was still a part of. We knew that Locol had broke ground on...something. As a business it only lasted two and a half years, but as a concept, it enlightened so many things. It brought so much conversation and attention to the problem of disparity and food access. From the beginning that I met Kim, I knew that this was the path to the second chapter of Locol,\" says Choi. \n\nCo-founder Kim Gaston shares about the origins of its community-minded design thinking: \"When we started Chewbox we wanted to focus on a customer that food service as a whole hadn't evolved to serve. And we started with a small pilot with schoolteachers because schoolteachers all over the county and they're all over South Central Los Angeles and they're all over Watts. They all have the same lunch problem, which is that they have thirty minutes between bells to receive and consume meals and be back on duty. Teachers are a vastly underserved population when it comes to lunch. What we were able to see from that was that this particular problem that we saw was scalable.\"\n\nChoi sums up Chewbox as a progression of old ideas. \"This is kind of like a paper route at the core of what old-school 50's Americana was based around at a time [now] when our whole idea and conception of what America is is being challenged. And that idyllic, Norman Rockwell universe of what we thought America was really about, there was a whole population of people—especially African Americans—who were left out of that. And it's this weird circle between what America could have been and should have been but wasn't, reinvented in the new modern age but including everybody, especially the people who were left out.\"\n\n🎧 To hear more of @kcrwevan's conversation with @chefroychoi and @abruthacancook, catch our latest episode on the @kcrw app or wherever you get podcasts.",
  "Tunde Wey is an activist and chef who investigates food and food media in America. He had a roving dinner series called \"Blackness in America\" that existed where food and commentary intersect to bring food to the space of uncomfortable conversations. \n\n\"That was a protest against contemporary food culture with too much focus on superficial things. I decided to start cooking Nigerian food and sharing that to protest that. But food culture is part of a larger system of power and oppression. \n\nWe are fed the idea that there's a certain aesthetic or expectation that gets awarded. But the truth is, it's neither the expectation nor the style nor the aesthetic nor the approach. It's the ideology which validates and highlights whiteness. That is what is rewarded over and over again. When other non-white ideas and perspectives and people  are recognized, it's usually in a tokenized fashion. And it's something we have to be honest and address if we want things to change as we say we do. \n\nWe are at a place where we can't afford to be neutral or to not have a position. It is important to me and the work that I do in the dining spaces I've tried to create to inject a morality, to inject a point of view because we are all politicized whether we choose to accept it or not. The people who don't want to recognize their politics are the people who have the privilege not to. \n\nWhatever personal privilege or influence that I have, my goal is to direct all of that to politicizing spaces that haven't been or choose not to be so we can lay it all out on the table and say, 'This is who we are and this is what we must change' if we want to change.”\n\n🎧 For more of @kcrwevan's conversation with @from_lagos, hear the latest episode on the @kcrw app or wherever you get your podcasts. 📷: Moyo Oyelola",
  "The idea of queer-centered spaces in the food and beverage world is not new. Meghan McCarron has been documenting queer food culture for @eater where she's a special correspondent. We talked to her about the history and future of queer food spaces. \n\n\"When we think about queer culture and what's been covered and easier to cover for historians, it's the gay bar, but these restaurant spaces that were welcoming and places where you feel you could linger have been important for a long time. As food has become such a culturally important thing, exploring restaurants has become a social pastime for all sorts of people, having queer spaces that are food-centric and not just bar-centric has definitely become a bigger thing in the past few years,\" McCarron shares. \n\n\"I think the reality is that to be a queer Millennial, there is a bit of an opening in the queer experience. You went to these bars because it was illegal for women to dress in men's clothing, any sort of same-sex dancing was illegal so you needed these more underground spaces. But now that some parts of queer life are more out in the open, you can move it into not just bars but coffee shops and diners and things like that so that is a positive thing.\"\n\nBut in a pandemic with unknown consequences, more queer spaces face closing than are opening. \"It's a really tough time for queer spaces and queer people. I really feel the lack of not being able to go to events or a space that's queer-centric being stuck in my own home. I've been getting to know my neighbors more but I can only imagine what it's like for these business owners just trying to find a way to survive.\" \n\n🎧 More of their conversation on @kcrw or wherever you get your podcasts.

  "Cooking fatigue has been a big topic of discussion lately with our time constantly at home but the fact remains we still have to eat. Rather than turning on the oven, especially with temperatures warming, we're keeping it together between two slices of bread.\n\nWe talked to Peter Lemos of the public radio-naming sandwich shop Wax Paper (pictured above is the @iraglass) about how some bread works better with the insides than other bread does, and where he begins when he's thinking about putting together a new sandwich.\n.\n“For me the creativity comes from anywhere. It can come from a car that I saw on the freeway or a color I saw on a sign or a piece of music I'm listening to. I always like to challenge myself to use one ingredient in as many different ways as I can. It makes it exciting to eat and exciting to cook.\"\n.\nIn the art and architecture of sandwich construction it's about the details, Lemos believes. \"Everything makes a difference like the way you cut something to the way you lay it down. It even makes a difference if you eat it with the cheddar cheese on the top. It's gonna taste different than if you flipped it over and the avocado was on the roof of your mouth. And you want to think about that when you're making a sandwich. How is somebody gonna eat this?\"\n___\n🎧 For more on @waxpaperco, check our latest episode online @kcrw and visit their shops that have or had sandwiches named after @garthtrinidad @travisholcombe @kcrwevan and maybe soon-to-be @themadbrand in the Frogtown or Chinatown neighborhoods of Los Angeles. #ItsASandwich 📷: Jakob N.

  "Danielle Bell and Pablo Osorio are the duo behind @de__porres, a Los Angeles-based dinner series and catering company. Bell described how they celebrate #Juneteenth, also known as Freedom Day, which commemorates the day enslaved Texans were finally told they had been freed by the Emancipation Proclamation two years earlier.\n.\n\"Pablo and I like to use Juneteenth as a way to bring people together and tell various stories. Our focus this year will be on Black Kentuckians' contribution to Kentucky's culinary history, often overlooked. It was really cool to see [this cookbook published in 1904], these menus and these dishes that were really decadent. There were maybe ten recipes for sweetbread, there was a lot of quail. I liked that idea of rural Black Kentuckians making this Haute cuisine.\"\n.\nWhile food is a big part of Juneteenth celebrations, it revolves around conjuring the spirit and aromas of ancestors. \"If I were in Kentucky right now, it would be BBQ. I would see a lot of pickled vegetables—scallions and tomatoes and onions and vinegar—there would be greens, my grandmother would maybe break out some chitlins. I would contribute ice cream and cobbler. But everybody has their traditions and dishes that speak to them. I imagine every table looks alike but different as well.\"\n.\nBell considered adapting their Juneteenth dinner for quarantine through Zoom, but felt that something meant to celebrate Black culture, history, and community would be lost. \"It's such a hard time, a bittersweet time, more bitter than sweet, so I'm just trying to think of ways to bring people together and it's just different.\"\n.\n\"I might send flowers with the dinner to kind of feel like what we do in our dinner parties. It's really important to me having fresh flowers and having candles. And 15% of our proceeds will go to the West Louisville Women's Collaborative. They promote art, meditation, gardening, wellness, and all sorts of activities to build a better West Louisville and support women and girls.\"\n___\n🎧 For more, check our latest episode online @kcrw and visit our #linkinbio for more on the West Louisville Women’s Collaborative | 📷: Stefanie Parkinson",

  "The business of food and restaurants is to care for other people. Now that same business is trying to figure out how to nurture their own, to help those on whose backs the industry operates to survive. It will be a big job, and the scale of the problem requires a really big solution. For businesses and workers with no job security, no savings, it’s a fight for survival.\n.\nChef Jose Andres, restauranteur and founder of the nonprofit World Central Kitchen, recently wrote an op-ed in the @nytimes proposing how to get people back to work while feeding our most vulnerable in a plan called America Eats Now.\n.\n“This crisis is like something we have never experienced before. Over the last 11 years, we’ve responded to volcanos, hurricanes, tsunamis, earthquakes, fires, to political unrest.” But this is different, Andres says.\n.\n“We are one of the biggest industries. We are four times bigger than the airline industry. We are a very important part of the GDP and running this country. Restaurants are small business owners, and we are at the heart of what America stands for. One meal at a time, we shape the DNA of who we are, what our neighborhoods are, what our cities are. We need to make sure we give value to that.”\n.\nDespite the gravity of what’s at stake for restaurants at large, Chef Andres is hopeful that this crisis can be an unfortunate catalyst for change. “I believe that after this, there are a lot of things we are going to be changing as a people, as a nation, as a planet.”\n.\n“We are going to see that we are only as good as the people around us doing well. That the new American Dream is not only to provide for you and your own and the people you love [but] also to make sure that we provide to those people we don’t know. It cannot be that my success is at the expense of your failure. It has to be that my success is because you are also succeeding. I think this is going to be that moment. I do believe that after this, we are going to see the world in a very different way.”\n___\n🎧 For more of @chefjoseandres’s conversation with @kcrwevan, listen on @kcrw online or wherever you get your podcasts. | 📷: @wckitchen",

For me comfort right now is knowing you are there, the Good Food community with whom I socially distance every week through the magic of broadcasted audio. What is happening to all of us is unprecedented, difficult and in constant flux.\n.\nHow can an entire industry that is one of the largest employers in the country recover from this? How do individuals who work in the business with no safety net survive? The answer is that we don’t know. Nobody does. In the coming weeks, we’ll interview chefs and restaurateurs about what lies ahead, but for now, it’s all just too raw, too new.\n.\nMy heart aches for our community of restaurant folks and the farmers on whom we rely for so much more than bodily sustenance. For a couple of decades now, we’ve come to rely on public eating establishments for not only our celebrations, but our daily hit of sociability and closeness. They’re places to hang out, share food and drink, and catch up with each other in close quarters. That is gone for now.\n.\nAll we can do is be there for our small communities in whatever form we are allowed. We are social animals who do not thrive in isolation, so we will create new ways of expressing joy, blowing off steam with our besties, and even sharing all this around a table.\n.\n-Evan Kleiman (@kcrwevan)",
  "One in six kids face hunger in America, and many rely on school meal programs. As countries across the globe institute school closures, what does it mean for those students in America who have limited access to nutritious meals?\n_\n\"31 million kids eat lunch every day, about 15 million have breakfast at school, and a little over a million are having [dinner] after school. If their school closes for any reason, they are suddenly cut off from very critically-needed nutrition,\" says Bettina Elias Siegel, food writer and child policy advocate.\n_\n\"The USDA has procedures in place for school closures, but the problem is that the contingency plan that they have isn't really going to get the job done in a widespread outbreak,\" citing provisions including a requirement to serve meals to students in group settings, which doesn't work during social distancing and self-quarantine.\n_\nThe good news: \"Congress is being responsive. In my very quick reading of the [COVID-19 Child Nutrition Response Act] bill, it looks like it will overcome these red tape obstacles to really free up schools and districts to do what needs to be done to feed hungry kids.\n_\nThese crises come out of nowhere and really expose so many fault lines in our society. You suddenly realize if people can't take sick leave, they're likely to come into work sick. This is another one of those fault lines. Our social safety net for children in many cases is at school.

  "The cooking in most US school cafeteria programs has devolved into unbox-and-reheat. But for the 32 million children participating in school lunch programs, how can labor lead to healthier eating by student bodies?\n_\n\"A lot of schools still rely on frozen foods they're unboxing and baking. What that really means is that the schools have outsourced the work of cooking. Even if they have a pretty good union contract and their hourly wage is high, workers really struggle to get hours not only in the summertime, but on a daily basis,\" explains Professor Jennifer Gaddis.\n_\n\"One thing that can mean is that depending upon the district, you'll often find workers who are about 15 minutes under the minimum in order to quality for benefits. It can create a lot of turnover. That's not only bad for maintaining the quality of the program over time, but can also be really detrimental to the kids and the public health mission of using public schools as a place to introduce kids into new and healthy foods.\n_\nIt's a profession that's been highly feminized. Because of the relationship between gender and food work, and the way in which we value the work of caring for others in society, the work of preparing food and feeding kids in school kitchens and cafeterias has always been pretty economically devalued.\n_\nIt's quite important, particularly for young kids, to have a positive relationship with the people who are feeding them if they're going to be asked to try new foods. It goes over a lot better if they trust and like the person asking them to try new things.\"\n___\n🎧 Hear more about low wages and the quality of school lunches on the latest episode on @kcrw or wherever you get your podcasts.",

  "Frieda Caplan was a game changer for how Americans eat. Known as the \"Mick Jagger of the produce world,\" she introduced lesser-known fruits and vegetables to our grocery aisle, including kiwis, passion fruit, starfruit, blood oranges, shiitake mushrooms, turmeric, and more. She passed away recently at the age of 96. @gustavo_arellano joined @kcrwevan to discuss her legacy in a male-dominated industry.\n_\n\"Frieda was not someone that was gonna let her gender define her, and was not gonna be pushed around by other people. The Packer named her the first-ever woman to win Produce Man of the Year [in] 1979. She goes to the banquet and sees the plaque and gives it back to them. She's like, 'I'm not the Produce Man of the Year.' So they gave her another plaque that said Produce Marketer of the Year, and that's the name that the award still has today,” Arellano recounts. \n_\n“Mary Landis, who was a longtime forager for Frieda's would say how every Wednesday, Frieda would basically run down the hallway so she could be the first person there at the kitchen. She'd ask the most questions, she'd laugh the loudest, she'd always have the first sample, and more often than not, she wouldn't leave any for anyone because that's how enthusiastic she was, even in her later years.\" She introduced at least 200 fruits and vegetables, but she made her name with the kiwi.\n___\n🎧 Hear more on Frieda’s fruitful legacy on the latest episode of Good Food online at @kcrw or wherever you get your podcasts. | 📷: Rick Loomis / Los Angeles Times",
  "It’s 2020 and @bill_addison joined @kcrwevan in the studio to talk about his look back at the past decade of dining in LA for the @latimes. \"The food world started to become less Eurocentric, to value diversity more, and to finally have a conversation around authenticity—whether it matters, who it discounts, and who is making those kinds of calls.”\n_\n“It has been a radical decade in dining for Los Angeles—a time when once-quiet neighborhoods became restaurant destinations, when culinary spaces decentralized, when a sense of ownership and pride in L.A.’s uniqueness settled into the city’s marrow,\" Addison writes.\n_\nIt's impossible to talk about the growth of culinary culture in Los Angeles without talking about Jonathan Gold. Laurie Ochoa, deputy editor at the Los Angeles Times as well as Gold's wife, says in retrospect: \"Food became a full-blown cultural event this decade. The thing that stood out about the first time Jonathan and I went to check out @kogibbq in Rosemead: We met people who had come from all over Los Angeles. They were talking in line to one another, taking pictures, tweeting. The line was as much of an event as the food; there was an excitement about what they were going to eat. Even though so many of the cuisines talked about this decade have been around for a long time, it felt like people were rediscovering the city in a different way.\"\n___\n🎧 Hear the rest of their conversation on the latest episode of Good Food on @kcrw or wherever you get your podcasts.

  "As the world grows warmer and oceans rise, sustainability and the politics of consumption become increasingly critical. To examine how the seafood we eat and the choices we make and continue to make factor into the big picture, Good Food heads to Australia to visit Josh Niland, a young chef putting every part of the day’s catch to use, which he calls cooking “fin-to-fin.”\n_\n“We’re only [typically] using 50 percent, and if you’re a small business like I am, that just doesn’t add up. The only two things that go in the bin when I process a fish are the gills and the gall bladder. But everything else—from blood, stomach, liver, spleen, hearts, eyes, fish bone, roe, scales, heads—you name it.”\n_\n“The other big problem is this fascination we have with washing a fish once it comes out of the water. A fish is porous—its scales take on water like a sponge. What meat butcher have you seen break down a cow and then take a strip loin off the carcass and dip that in water or run it under a tap and then put it on ice and try to serve it? I’ve never seen that in my life. If we did, maybe there would be a thing as ‘beefy beef.’ Because we continue to refer to fish as ‘fishy fish.’”\n_\nLike other learned norms, Chef Niland believes that new ideas can lead to change in culture, however. “Through good handling and great storage, we can see a shelf life of a fish go from four days to up to four weeks, at the very least.”\n___\n🎧 Hear more from Josh and his book, “The Whole Fish Cookbook” in this week’s new episode on @kcrw or wherever you get your podcasts. | 📷: Rob Palmer",

And if you do brine, how many days in advance and what ingredients/ratios do you use?⁣⁣\n- Kristin Smith⁣⁣\n⁣⁣\nEvan Kleiman: I dry brine, which simply means salting the bird with Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt three days before roasting.

  "Over the past year, an unprecedented number of food shows have hit streaming platforms. One of the bigger surprises is @thechefshownetflix, a collaboration between director Jon Favreau and Chef Roy Choi, now in season 2. After working together on Favreau’s movie Chef in 2014, the two kept cooking together. \n_\n\"I treated it more like a documentary than a show with a heavy format. My feeling was that if we just had real moments, and filmed us doing the real thing, I was confident that we could figure out a format and a structure that would allow those things to emerge. I started adding music that KCRW DJ @mathieuschreyer oversaw, stop-motion, and a format emerged just from filming us cooking. The only objective was to be authentic, genuine, and cook with people who were as excited about cooking as we were. There’s something really satisfying about this project that has turned into something that has meant a great deal to us.” Favreau shares.\n_\nAs for Choi’s motivation: “I really loved teaching shows that were cooking in real time all the way through. When you’re busy doing something, the conversations become effortless.  This show allowed me to be who I really am in the kitchen.\"\n_\nChoi continues, “I equate our show to driving and around the corner and there’s a stream of lights and a taco stand with a huge line and you never knew it was there. There’s a bit of discovery. In that moment you don’t have to learn the whole Wikipedia page about that taquero. You just go and experience the thing, you just jump right in.

  "Earlier this year, the @beardfoundation announced its nominations from Houston, Texas. With a population of 2.3 million, it’s been called the most diverse city in the US. There isn’t an ethnic majority and 1 in 4 residents were born in another country. It’s a mixture of cultures that shapes the city’s palette in some truly unique ways.\n_\nChris Shepherd is a chef and restauranteur who truly embodies the city’s ethos. He talked to Good Food about how to cook in a way that’s rooted in where we live. \n_\n“Vietnamese is everywhere. There are banh mi and pho shops everywhere in this city. It’s not 'this is this section, this is this section’ The Mexican and Salvadoran communities are everywhere. There is an Asiatown in Bellaire, which is 6 miles of Vientnamese, Chinese, Korean. There’s food from Hidalgo right next to a Thai spot and across the street is a Vietnamese restaurant. It’s beautiful to see how integrated as a city we can be.”\n_\nBut what’s the line between honoring cultures and cultural appropriation in the food space? “It’s highlighting and supporting and loving people. I want our food to be the gateway for people to go out and experience these things on their own. We have photos on our wall that kind of say, ‘If you like this [from my menu] then go eat that.\" There’s a 'Thank you so much for coming in today. We really appreciate it and would like to have you back, but we politely request that you visit one of these places before you do.’ It’s kind of a roadmap to our city, so when people come back and tell us ‘I’ve been here, I’ve been here, I’ve been here, I met this person…’—to me that’s understanding where you’re at, and that’s Cook Like a Local. You can do that in any city in the country if you’re just willing to.”\n___\n🎧 Hear more on @kcrw or wherever you get your podcasts. | 📷: @juliesoefer",
  "For more than five thousand years, Jewish families have made their homes in Italy.

Growing up in Los Angeles, I was very connected to my mom’s family so I spent a lot of time in Bologna with my grandparents.

The existing Italian-Jewish community is one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world.” Samson said he learned a lot in his research about the history of Italian Jews in preparation for his Cucina Ebraica menu. \"Italian food is very rich, but it can be kind of austere. What that means to me is you have to be a lot more on point with the way you handle it. You have to make sure everything is cooked perfectly, and make sure everything's seasoned perfectly.

He looked past the dogma that exists in pretty much everything the Italians do. He basically opened my mind to deconstruct what is typically acceptable and put it back together while discarding things I did not agree with. Over time, I began to formulate ways to take this very cottage industry and turn it into pasta that feels like it's made by a machine but still has that touch of handmade,\" said Funke. \n_\n\"Pasta, very much like bread, is formulaic. It's mathematics. It's the measurement of ingredients and time and structure and all of these very binary things. If you look at the romance of pasta, you don't see any of that. But I look at the structure and the architecture and the balance of hydration and the age of the flour, and all these things nobody pays attention to. I really broke it apart as much as I possibly could to control each and every single element.\"\n_\n\"It's a process I've developed over 11 years.

  "Since @sonoratownla was featured in Netflix's Taco Chronicles, lines started to form around the block for their tacos and beef chivis every day. But their success wasn't always guaranteed. \n_\nWhen they began in 2016 at the height of gluten-free era, co-owners Jennifer Feltham and Teo Diaz-Rodriguez had originally planned to buy their tortillas to save time, but couldn't find any that were right for the style in Teo's mom's recipe. They decided to source their flour from Sonora, Bonfil's heirloom wheat that grows in Northern México that makes a softer, more pliable, elastic tortilla that's helped change opinions on the authenticity of flour tortillas.\n_\n\"It's always fun to explain to people that corn tortillas are a part of México, but so are flour. There's a long history in Sonora of making flour tortillas, and people there are very proud of what they do and their culture, and I'm happy to be able to share that with Angelenos,\" Feltham says. \n_\n\"I think people are getting a lot more interested in regional cuisine than they've ever been. For a long time, Mexican food was just one thing.

So I think people are learning a little bit more about the different regions of México and what you can expect to find style-wise.\"\n_\nThanks to a recently expanded kitchen staff, wait times have been cut down while curated playlists help with that too (\"Some of the best Mexican music in Southern California,\" says Gustavo). \"I love bringing some of the back of the house into the front of the house here at my restaurant, making it all one.

  "Los Angeles is home to the largest ethnic Salvadoran population outside of El Salvador, noted by the many pupusas and aguas frescas and other Salvadoran favorites in LA. But with the high cost of importing traditional Salvadoran ingredients and the loss of family recipes in the diaspora due to the Salvadoran Civil War, what counts as a truly authentic Salvadoran dish? \n_\nLA food writer Karla Vasquez has been exploring this question through a project to preserve Salvi recipes through generations in the US. She hosts Salvadoran cooking workshops in LA focused on traditional recipes mostly for attendees who grew up with Salvi moms and grandmothers in the kitchen.\n_\n\"When I was younger, I didn't really pay attention in the kitchen so much and I lost my mom when I was 15 so I didn't get the opportunity as an adult to say, ‘Ok mom, show me what to do.' So I'm learning this so I can pass it off to my kids because I'm a first generation here and I wouldn't want that to end with me.\" says Jennifer Corletto, a workshop attendee. \n_\nThis is more than a cooking class. It's about being able to give a part of yourself to your children through food that can represent history and stability. And sharing recipes is something that can get lost when moms have too much on their plate.\n_\nThis idea led to Karla’s cookbook SalviSoul, made up of Salvadoran recipes for rellenos de pacayas, torrejas, chilate, and the personal stories of twenty-five LA women who immigrated from El Salvador behind each dish. \n_\n\"This is the legacy of the Salvadoran mom and what she's done for her children, and what she's done for her family,” Vasquez says.\n___\n🎧 For more of a taste of El Salvador and contributor Audrey Ngo's story through the Independent Producer Project, check out our latest episode wherever you get your podcasts. | 📷: Audrey Ngo",

  "Lulu Wang is the director of The Farewell, a movie based on a lie she told in real life when she went back to China after learning her grandmother was diagnosed with lung cancer. Her family made the decision to not tell her grandmother about her diagnosis and instead planned an elaborate impromptu wedding as an excuse to say goodbye to their matriarch. It's about the power of food to bring us together when words won't do, and food also plays an interesting role in the film as a manifestation of grief.\n_\n\"Normally when we see a story about Asian American families, food is always at the forefront of the culture because it's an expression of love. But because the family is grieving, the one thing that they've lost is their appetite. I wanted to use food as a way to visualize the internal tension that the family is facing. They're not at a celebration but are gathered under the guise of a wedding and the one way they can express love back to Nai Nai, grandma, is by eating her food,\" Wang explains. \n_\n\"I wanted the food and the eating to be part of the texture of the family and of life, and not above it. Not romanticized, not idealized, and not made to be food porn. I think that's a very American thing that we've suddenly discovered food culture and now we're all foodies. In these ancient cultures, nobody is a foodie and nobody is a non-foodie. Everybody just eats food and good food,\" says the director. \n_\n\"Especially in middle class and lower income families in the villages and out in the farms, people don't have access to high quality foods, and meat is very expensive. They really just value the very little bit they can get. It's the thing that brings family together, it's the thing that brings joy to the family. So it was important for me to make it realistic and not do these solo close-up shots of it as a way to elevate or romanticize it in any way.\"\n___\n🎧 Hear more of Lulu's conversation with Evan about spending time together with family in as truthful and honest a way as possible without ever talking about the one elephant in the room. |📷: A24 / The Farewell",

It urges chefs to find their own somewhereness in the foods they serve,\" he wrote for Eater.\n_\n\"When we think about what we care most about [in food writing] today, about not just what we're eating on the plate, but why we're eating it and how we're eating it and with whom we're eating it—that comes straight from Jonathan's work. The man who taught us all, every week, about broadening our own sense of community,\" Addison reflects. \n_\nAt a time when restaurant criticism was fixated on fine dining, Jonathan Gold championed taco trucks, Ethiopian food, and San Gabriel Valley noodle shops. His insistence on taking these cuisines seriously built bridges to understanding and respecting other cultures, saved restaurants, transformed lives, and brought a renewed sense of pride to those communities.\n_\nSharing Jonathan's own advice on finding good food out in the world: \"If you're in a restaurant that has mostly dishes that you've never heard of, don't order the dish that you have heard of. It's not there for the right reasons.\" Happy birthday, Jonathan. \n___\n🎧 Hear the rest of the episode that was nominated for a 2019 James Beard Broadcast Media Award for Radio wherever you get your podcasts. | 📷: Nick Liao / KCRW",
  "Today marks the one-year anniversary of Jonathan Gold's passing. His writing interpreted LA’s food culture to the world, using his singular voice to plant its basis always in humanity. Amy Scattergood was one of the Pulitzer Prize-winning restaurant critic's longtime collaborators at the LA Times, and joined us to assess his legacy and impact a year later​.\n_\n“Jonathan didn’t chase trends. He always felt like he had a bigger mandate that was about people,” says Scattergood. “You could always tell if there was a restaurant that was too trendy or if he really wasn’t interested. He’d just go, ‘Yeah, maybe, but instead I’m gonna do this. And you’re gonna like it.’ And we did because it had a way to get us all to the table. And not because some PR agency told us to go some place, but because the food was good. He just wouldn’t do it unless he felt it was right.\"\n​_​\n“Carrying the torch means ignoring the PR stuff and going back to the tables that are interesting and worthwhile and say something about the people who are cooking the food, or the people who are eating the food, or about our city or someone else’s city and just providing a voice for those people—people who often don’t have voices. He did that.\"\n​_​\n“If I can’t hear him talk now, then I want to read him.​ I loved reading what he wrote. That’s what I miss. What we can do now is we can reread him. The beautiful thing about being a writer is that it’s there. We can go pull it up.”​\n_\nAt Grand Central Market​​, there is a plaque hanging in honor of his legacy as a writer and lifelong Angeleno. Beneath his silhouette, it reads: Jonathan Gold, Son of Los Angeles.​\n​___​\n​🎧 Hear the rest of the tribute in this week’s show wherever you get your podcasts. 📷: Duston Todd / Nick Liao",
  "The repertoire of Thai cooking is full of incredibly delicious noodle dishes. From the brothy to the pan-fried, you can customize them in endless ways. In his latest book, \"Pok Pok Noodles: Recipes from Thailand and Beyond,\" Pok Pok chef and founder Andy Ricker shares how he recreates some of his restaurants’ most popular Thai noodle dishes at home, which are mostly Chinese in origin.\n_\nOwing to waves of immigration from China at the end of the 17th and 19th centuries, the Chinese culinary influence was accelerated by Thailand’s urbanization, when people started migrating to cities in greater numbers. “These workforces needed something to eat that was quick and easy,\" Ricker says. \n_\n\"With the influx of Chinese traders and workers there, the tradition of serving noodles like this came with them. So these new city dwellers who needed a quick lunch who weren't at home gave rise to this new way of eating,” he reveals. \n___\n🎧 Hear more of Andy's conversation with Evan about Thai noodle history in the latest episode wherever you get your podcasts. | 📷: Austin Bush",
  "The world is small. It doesn’t matter where you live, we’re connected across mountains, plains, and oceans not only by what we eat but the way we eat. That’s especially true in Asian cities like former Saigon, where one-tenth of the population makes a living selling food on the street. \n_\nDavid Gelb, the creator and director of Chef’s Table, is back with another Netflix show with a more populist slant. In Street Food, Gelb’s team is telling the personal stories of street food vendors in nine different Asian cities from Delhi to Seoul.\n_\n“The idea came from when we would shoot Chef’s Table, the chefs or staff would take us to their favorite street food spots. You realized that they are as passionate as any three-star Michelin chef. The stakes of their story are often higher because they’re cooking to feed their families, just for pure survival even,” says Gelb.\n_\n“We thought it was interesting to be able to tell the story of a city, and the street food is a vibrant center that brings people together and becomes a part of the everyday routine. Each episode is a feeling of that city and of that place.”\n_\nStreet food is so intrinsic to daily life in Asia because of how small home kitchens are designed without ovens or sometimes even burners. “It’s an everyday thing. A lot of people who hang out at street food joints, it’s like a community. It’s a feeling of getting together—like the opposite of ordering Postmates and eating in front of the TV—a little social, fun scene that people love taking part in that’s part of their everyday lives that just brings joy,” Gelb shares.\n___\n🎧 Hear more about this and the grateful submission to the focus of making one food for your entire life wherever you get your podcasts. | 📷: Courtesy of Netflix",

  "From the outside, the restaurant world can seem like a place of opportunity with hard work and talent. But three-fourths of all food businesses are owned by men, and women on average make 73 cents to a man’s dollar, without accounting for race and economic status.\n_\nLa Cocina was founded in San Francisco’s Mission District to level the playing field, and the kitchen incubator has worked with hundreds of talented cooks and entrepreneurs from low income communities since 2005. \"The general premise of La Cocina is that there are barriers of entry that shouldn’t exist, specifically for women of color entrepreneurs. When you address those barriers directly, the outcomes for your economy look a lot different—more inclusive, more vibrant, more delicious, more innovative,\" says executive director Caleb Zigas.\n_\nWhen they were asked why they didn’t formalize their businesses, many of these women cited a lack of affordable kitchen space. “So the idea for La Cocina was that if those talented entrepreneurs had access to affordable commercial kitchen space and food industry-specific technical assistance, that they could move from the informal economy to the formal economy, and from income patching into asset generation.”\n_\nZigas noticed that one of the challenges at La Cocina is helping food entrepreneurs push through what he calls a “confidence gap” that comes from internalizing what risks they can’t take. “Part of our biggest jobs is to say, ‘Of course you can. You can fail like all the other businesses in the Bay Area who are so proud of failing their way toward success.' The entrepreneurs at La Cocina should have every opportunity to do that too.”\n__\n🎧 Hear more of Evan's conversation with Caleb and Dilsa about creating parity in economic opportunity in any city on this week's episode. | 📷: Eric Wolfinger",

  "This coming Tuesday, June 25 has been declared Bourdain Day, established by chefs Eric Ripert and José Andrés to celebrate the late chef, star, food anthropologist, and friend, Anthony Bourdain. Just over a year ago, Evan happened to be in New York the day after his passing was announced. She visited a spontaneous sidewalk memorial that had appeared outside the old Brasserie Les Halles where Bourdain served as executive chef for many years, seemingly born out of a loss so personal that the public needed to construct a physical place to shore their pain.\n_\n“I know that for me, he was always someone who looked deeper than almost anyone at the complicated human story that food tells. Perhaps that is why the loss of our favorite hard-ass and thinking person Anthony Bourdain is still so damn hard. The aching loss of such insight and humanity right when we need it the most still hurts as does the knowledge of how much he must have been hurting. For many of us, it’s been a year of being there for friends, for family and colleagues. Of showing up. It’s the least we can do,\" Evan reflects. \n_\nJoin us this week as we revisit some of Bourdain's classic interviews with Good Food back to 2000 after his breakthrough tell-all \"Kitchen Confidential\" came out to his evolutions through stardom and fatherhood, as well as his spot on KCRW's Guest DJ Project featuring his love of punk and the music that changed his life. Thanks for everything you shared, Anthony.\n___\n📷: Nick Liao / KCRW / Bloomsbury USA / Peabody Awards",
  "Los Angeles is home to movies, make-believe, and the tiki bar. Paola Mardo recently dove deep into the history and Filipino origins of tiki bars from one of the oldest in Los Angeles that's still owned by the same family who opened it back in 1961: Tiki-Ti. \n_\n\"My dad came here in 1930 from the Philippines. He started working at the Figueroa Hotel as a bellhop. Then he got a job at the Beverly Hills Hotel. The manager told him Prohibition was ending, and [they wanted] to send him to bartending school. He went and when he got out, Donn Gantt was opening Don the Beachcomber [the first tiki bar] and he hired him,\" says Mike Buhen, son of original Tiki-Ti owner Ray Buhen. \n_\nRay was part of the first big wave of Filipino immigrants to the US. Because of restricted immigration laws, Filipino immigrants at the time were mostly men. This was the generation of manongs, or uncles, who came to LA in search of the American Dream but had to settle for something completely different instead. \n_\nRay was one of these men, and despite the odds, he worked his way up through different tiki bars, mixing drinks for Hollywood celebrities and Angelenos for decades. These places hired a lot of Filipino workers to do everything from serve food to carve ice sculptures. But his drinks were so famous that he was able to open a tiki bar of his own: the Tiki-Ti in 1961. \n_\nRay Buhen passed away in 1999, but his son, Mike, is continuing the family business.\n___\n🎧 Hear more on this piece of family and Los Angeles history on @longdistanceradio in addition to the latest episode of Good Food wherever you get your podcasts. | 📷: Patrick Epino",
  "José Andrés is one of the most celebrated chefs in the world with multiple Michelin stars and James Beard awards to his name, but he's known as much for his humanitarian efforts in places like Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria as he is for his avant-garde style of Spanish cooking. In his new cookbook, Vegetables Unleashed, he believes vegetables are finally getting their due.\n_\n\"In a way, it's an homage to vegetables. But deep underneath giving vegetables the respect they deserve, I think we're giving respect to the men and women that work in the fields in America and around the world to produce those vegetables to keep feeding humanity.\n_\nFood is an opportunity to create a better world, and we need to seize that opportunity. Food should be the answer to have a cleaner planet where the workers are well paid, where we don't use undocumented immigrants to farm the land of America so we can eat. We mistreat those people in a way that nobody even thinks about anymore. Food production touches many things,” Andrés insists.\n___\n🎧 Listen to more of Chef Andrés' conversation with Evan about eating smarter as well as his tribute to late friend Anthony Bourdain wherever you get your podcasts. | 📷: Peter Frank Edwards",
  "Turkey is one-thirteenth the size of the U.S. but is equally diverse in topography, resulting in a remarkably rich and varied table. In “Istanbul and Beyond,” travel writer Robyn Eckhardt explores the country’s many culinary influences, while Davíd Hagerman’s photos capture the cuisine’s vibrancy.\n_\n“In general, photography is about relationships. I shoot a lot of food because food is sort of the doorway to get into cultures, and people are very willing to talk about food. The Turkish people were extremely warm and welcoming.\n_\nFor me, it was a matter of being out in the fields where people are making food, people are doing things, [people are] harvesting. I think a lot of the images from the book come from trying to understand where things came from. I'm sort of less interested in the final dish than the process of getting there. And from that, we really got the idea that from the land comes the food,” Hagerman says. \n_\nRobyn noted how much cuisines differ from region to region. “I guess what struck me—it was kind of a revelation—was the degree to which we in America can't really imagine the degree to which what people eat is determined by where they live and the topography and climate around them.”\n___\n🎧 Hear more of Robyn and Dave’s conversation about land and table with Evan wherever you get your podcasts.\n📷: David Hagerman",

There was a real defined effort to not only change the dishes but change the name itself.\n_\nWe’re talking about a food culture that’s been pretty wholly whitewashed over and it’s only in the past couple of generations started to come back with regional specifics of Mexican food.

And yet there's this part of it where if you're not a man, you're not allowed to go near it.

But Australian Uighurs want the halal meat pies, hand-pulled noodles and lamb kebabs to stay on the menu.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nThere have been ethnic tensions in Xinjiang since China began governing the region in 1949. Anti-government protests have occasionally become violent. Now some separatists want to establish an independent state in Xinjiang called East Turkestan.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nOver the past decade, the Chinese government has made a significant effort to keep control of the Xinjiang region and to encourage Uighurs to be more loyal to the Chinese nation. Authorities released a list of 75 signs of religious extremism citizens should watch out for. Men growing beards, women who refuse to shake hands with men, and anyone abstaining from drinking alcohol all made the list.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nIn April 2017, the Chinese government stepped up the campaign. Tens of thousands of Uighurs were swept up and detained in internment camps. Now as many as 2 million members of Muslim minority groups are being held in hundreds of camps in western China, according to recent US State Department estimates. The Chinese government calls these camps re-education centers that are aimed at stamping out terrorism and religious extremism.

I spent every weekend of last year illustrating the episodes of @kcrwgoodfood and heard @the_thejgold’s reviews but I didn’t draw them. I wanted to focus on other segments each week instead of restaurants that might be here one day, gone the next. I didn’t think much of it. Cut to a couple months ago when I was a judge alongside Jonathan at the @kcrw Pie Contest, I asked him for a photo & introduced myself, he said he liked my art and had my Good Food totebag. I was stoked & flattered! He also said “I know you’re a vegan too”. Haha, wow, I guess J Gold had a file on me! But then he said very sincerely, “And I know you don’t draw any of my segments..” 😳 “Awww, J Gold, sorry, were you waiting for that?” I blurted out. “Well, yeah!” he said. I explained my reasoning and he agreed that was smart of me, but I told him I’d make it up to him and illustrate one of his Good Food reviews sometime and I made a note in my sketchbook to do so...I know I barely knew him, but he had such an impact on me and all the food nerds in this town and beyond. This morning I woke up and went back and listened to a bunch of his interviews from Good Food last year. I figured I should keep my promise and illustrate something for him. This is my tribute to the late, great Jonathan Gold, some great lines about some great restaurants. I’ll even tag it #stacydrawsgoodfood2017 so it can be part of that series, which I think he’d be happy about. 💝✨🙌🍽",
