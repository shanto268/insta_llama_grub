  "Korean food @borit_gogae_kfood \ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddf7 Healthy and tasty, just like home.",
  "KBBQ \ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddf7 at Soowon Galbi (@soowon_galbi)\nThis tops our KBBQ list along with Yangmani. Yangmani would be better for intestines and some other beef cuts; this is a galbi (rib) specialty shop.\n\nAlthough many get the marinated rib here QQ prefers the \u201cseng galbi\u201d because she doesn\u2019t like the sweet taste of the marinade. The beef was good, banchan were good, and although the restaurant was crowded service was still on point.",
  "Pakistani dinner at Kaan Saab (@khansaab_oc) in OC. Our favorite was the lamb chops!",
  "Ethiopian \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf9 at Meals by Genet (@mealsbygenet)\n\nOur favorite Ethiopian place in LA so far. Everything was well seasoned and had a clean, distinct flavor. Upper left side is the lamb and rest is veggie combo.",
  "Back at Le Champ (@lechamp_la \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7)! We always like to start with the endive salad and the coquilles St Jacques. And my favorite is the burger, which has a light wasabi flavor and a fat juicy patty, it\u2019s soo good!",
  "First time dining at Barrique (@barriquevenice \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9) We had the grilled octopus, lobster linguine, duck breast, and tronchetto. Everything was really good, especially the octopus! QQ wished the onions were less heavy on the honey but Bongo liked it. I think this might become our go-to Italian spot in the neighborhood, along with Cento!\n\nWe were in a cozy, romantic patio, service was attentive. Table on the smaller side.",
  "Japan \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5 \nIzakaya Ichie (@ichieizakaya) in The Source OC (@thesourceoc)\n\nEverything in the omakse bowl was super fresh. We also had the tako wasa and mentaiko cream udon which were really good. The table next to us got the yakitori which also looked delicious. Nice casual place that\u2019s great to hang out with friends. Definitely will return! \ud83d\ude42",
  "Yum woon sen, my favorite dish @ La La Rice (Thai \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\udded) Just the right amount of acidity and chili!",
  "Toranj (@toranj_restaurant_la) \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf7\n\nThe juicy chicken is juicy. Maybe the picture doesn\u2019t do justice. One of the nicer Persian restaurants- definitely will be back!",

  "Last dinner of the year @lechamp_la \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7\nHappy new year, everyone!\n\nOur favorites were trout and crab. Soo good! Every fish should be served with guava jam.",
  "Korea \ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddf7 @obsquare_tustin \n\n1. egg roll\n2. old style whole fried chicken\n3. army stew"
