  "No. 3\ufe0f\u20e36\ufe0f\u20e3: House Special from @phnompenhnoodleshack in Long Beach\n\nToday, one of LA\u2019s most quintessential Cambodian restaurants. Long Beach is home to the largest Cambodian community outside of Cambodia and Phnom Penh Noodle Shack has been serving folks a taste of home since 1985. \n\nThe namesake dish here is a noodle soup that\u2019s traditionally served for breakfast back in the homeland. In its early days, the restaurant used to open at 5 a.m. to cater to the Cambodian doughnut shop owners who needed something hearty after being up all night baking. \n\nThe extremely friendly staff suggested I order the soup dry, with the pork broth on the side. Why? Well because that way you get to experience both the unique flavor profile of the noodles, which they dress in a tangy soy-garlic dressing, and of the hyper-complex pork broth, which begins simmering at dawn each day. The house special comes with an assortment of meats, and the ideal procession is to pair a juicy hunk of pork with a mouthful of noodles, and chase it all down with a slurp of sweet and salty broth. \n\nStaff also recommended an order of the Chinese doughnut sticks, perfect for sopping up broth. \n\nWhile there are many excellent Cambodian spots in Long Beach, The Shack as it used to be known, is an absolute must-visit. Countdown Out. \n\n36 noodles down. 64 to go!!!\n\n#noodles #cambodia #losangeles #food",

  "@streetgourmetla joined the @lafoodpod to talk about his journey, as well as his thoughts on everything from Taco Bros to David Chang. \n\nAlso - I know what you're thinking - Luca, aren't you someone who makes videos about *gulp* sandwiches, pizza and even tacos? Yes, but I think what Bill is getting at is... it matters how you go about doing it. Don't be a Taco Bro. \n\nAlso on the pod, we talk about @katorestaurant getting @theworlds50best recognition, @michelinguide adding @cedrorestaurant @lola_gaspar @lustig.la and @elf_losangeles to the guide, what restaurants can expect 60 days out from the junk fee ban going into effect, and @sweetgreen decision to start selling beef. \n\nLink in bio!\n\n#podcast #food #losangeles #taco",
  "No. 3\ufe0f\u20e35\ufe0f\u20e3: @jilli.la and their Korean-Italian fusion pastas \n\nToday, a Koreatown watering hole with a couple of cheeky fusion pastas on the menu. \n\nWe're at Jilli, a \"sool jib\" or drinking establishment brought to us by the same folks who own Hanchic and fried chicken darlings Chimmelier. It's the kind of place where you drink first, eat second, and listen to loud 90s hip hop at every step of the way. \n\nThe menu is short but sweet, featuring fun, crushable dishes like crispy rice cakes glazed with gocjuhang and DIY salmon gimbap. \n\nNoodle-wise the dish you've probably seen on social media is the kimchi vodka rigatoni. This dish is undeniably good, fortified with a little guanciale and getting a nice depth of flavor from the kimchi's trademark sour umami twinge. \n\nThe noodle dish you've probably seen less of is this spaghetti in a doenjang cream sauce, served alongside seared scallops. This was probably my favorite bite of the night - it was essentially a well done seafood pasta dish with a delightful sweet salty kick courtesy of the doenjang.\n\nJilli's a great spot for a fresh and funky dinner with friends. Be sure to make a rez because it's in high demand right now. \n\n35 noodles down. 65 to go!!!\n\n#korean #food #losangeles #pasta",

  "No. 3\ufe0f\u20e34\ufe0f\u20e3: Guilin rice noodles from Mojie Noodle in Arcadia\n\nToday, an SGV food court joint specializing in a Chinese regional delicacy that dates back more than 2,000 years. Tucked inside the President Square Food Court in Arcadia, Mojie Noodle specializes in Guilin rice noodles. These are exactly what they sound like - thick, long noodles made of rice, created to feed Qin Dynasty Northern Chinese soldiers who had a hankering for noodles, but found themselves in Southern China where rice was the predominant food source. \n\nWhile in Guilin you\u2019d find rice noodles of all shapes, sizes and varieties, Mojie Noodle makes a long thick version and their most popular dish, the Number 1, is served dry, seasoned with a clean, savory pork broth and topped with charred bits of meats, lots of pickled goodies and some peanuts for crunch. \n\nThe noodles themselves remind me of that viral TikTok song from 2022 that goes \u201cmy money don\u2019t jiggle jiggle. Except, of course, in this case, the noodle do jiggle jiggle, fo sho. They\u2019re light and supple, yet retain a pleasant bite. The dish as a whole is extremely more-ish, especially if you, like me, add a healthy dollop of non-Momofuku brand chili crisp, and let the heat submerge your consciousness like an afternoon spent in Rick Rubin\u2019s sauna. \n\nAll in all, this is a fantastic plate of noodles, even if you have no appetite for absorbing their rich cultural relevance and history whatsoever. \n\n34 noodles down. 66 to go!!!\n\n#noodles #chinesefood #food #losangeles",
